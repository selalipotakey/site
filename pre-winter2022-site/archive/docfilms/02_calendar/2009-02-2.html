<h1> Spring 2009,  Tuesday &bull; Life Caught Unawares</h1>

<p class="seriesdesc">The evolution of the documentary, 1910-1940.</p><a href="#movies">Skip to the movie listings</a>

<div class="series-essay">

<p>In 1926, critic and future filmmaker John Grierson applied the term ``documentary'' to Robert Flaherty's Moana. Grierson praised the film for its emphasis on the ``original'', calling for this quality in more pictures of the time. Meanwhile, his contemporaries were fashioning similar definitions in attempts to pinpoint what separated their use of authentic imagery from current cinematic traditions. Director Pare Lorentz called this kind of cinema, ``a factual film which is dramatic'', while Russian filmmaker Dziga Vertov rhapsodized: ``life caught unawares.''</p>

<p>But the approach to filmmaking that these artists championed as an emergent genre was far from as pioneering as they believed. Grierson had merely given name to a quality that had existed since the medium's invention. Indeed, many of the earliest films might be called documentary according to the current, accepted definition. The work of the Fr&egrave;res Lumi&egrave;res consisted of short scenes depicting everyday occurrences: boats docking, a train entering a station, workers leaving a factory, etc. At the same time, these kinds of films were not specifically what Grierson and his colleagues had in mind when they theorized what filmmakers like Flaherty were creating. For them, ``documentary'' proposed an important stylistic and political alternative to the fictional feature film, at once reconciling that form's dramatic ambitions with the contingent elements definitive of everyday life.</p>

<p>The earliest feature films now identified as documentaries were described as ``actualities'' at the time, and resembled contemporary fiction films both structurally and thematically. It was believed that audiences would not be interested in a straightforward presentation of unfamiliar civilizations and places, that the image needed narrative framing. This was the impetus for placing a romance in a film such as Karl Brown's Stark Love where the implicit intention was to portray the rugged existence of Appalachian woodsmen. This assumed need for storytelling prompted a general twisting of the truth through creative editing and embellishments. Actuality films sought to excite audiences more than educate. On the other hand, today, films like Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life and South tend to impress us more for their images of vanished cultures than their gimmicky storytelling.</p>

<p>From the mid-1920s to the early 1930s, the documentary developed into a conscious art. The ``authentic'' images that had defined the actualities influenced a new generation of filmmakers who saw the form's political and historiographic potential. Exemplary were the avant-gardists of the 20s who developed an early poetic subgenre, the city symphony, which simultaneously illuminated social concerns. Experimenting with cinematography and montage to examine urban existance from original perspectives, films such as Rien que les heures and &Agrave; propos de Nice presented the disparity of upper and lower class lifestyles through playful imagery. </p>

<p>More and more, education and activism became the aim of these films, and fictional storylines were abandoned as the genre's popularity increased among practitioners. Identifying the documentary as a new artistic canvas, the master of Soviet cinema, Sergei Eisenstein, attempted to create a chronological epic addressing the history and politics of Mexico, later titled Que Viva Mexico! Thus, though the documentary had not lost its sense of the exotic, as evidenced by the Hollywood-financed exploitation venture Legong: Dance of the Virgins, many filmmakers now turned their eyes to the reality of their immediate surroundings rather than faraway countries. This led to other films of high artistic ambition, such as John Grierson's first feature Drifters, a harrowing account of the daily lives of British fishermen, and Pare Lorentz's government-financed propaganda films The Plow That Broke the Plains and The River, which were intended to present an uplifting image of America near the end of the Great Depression.</p>

<p>Like any burgeoning form, the documentary had its own iconoclast in the person of Joris Ivens, whose esthetics eloquently bespoke a coherent social historical philosophy to an extent that few had previously, by continually experimenting with style, and redefining the filmmaker's personal and artistic duty toward his subject. The Spanish Earth is a turning point in a career that spanned sixty years and approximately fifty films.</p>

<p>In this series, the transition from actualities to mature documentaries is signaled in the definitive shift by filmmakers of the late twenties and early thirties from a concern with the foreign and exotic to the domestic and familiar. The later work strives to heighten the audience's perception of the world through a plastic manipulation of the cinematic image, as Dziga Vertov describes it, ``&hellip;a mechanical eye&hellip;showing you a world, the likes of which only [the camera] can see.'' Earlier films had prompted the evolution of the genre by showing that narrative could be applied to ``original'' subjects, but the documentary was finally defined in these later manifestations, which instilled ``the original'' with a visionary significance that transcended mere storytelling.

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Frank Hurley, 1918</span> &bull; Already a world renowned explorer by 1914, Ernest Shackleton set out to be the first to cross Antarctica by way of the South Pole. Frank Hurley accompanied the crew to create a film of the explorer's hopeful milestone. Unfortunately, Shackleton's ship the Endurance became stuck in an ice flow, stranding the crew for months. Artfully photographed by Hurley, the film chronicles the day to day tasks of the crew as they persevere in this harsh environment. <em>South</em> is a great adventure story, but is most impressive when recording the minutiae of an explorer's existence. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Merian C. Cooper & Ernest B. Shoedsack, 1925</span> &bull; Inspired by Robert Flatherty's <em>Nanook of the North</em>, Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack, sought their own adventure to film and produced <em>Grass</em>, one of the earliest ethnographic documentaries. Grass follows the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia (now Iran), an estimated 50,000 people plus countless herds of livestock, as they travel across mountains and rivers to new pastures. In their first film together, Cooper and Shoedsack explore the narrative framing possibilities of the documentary, utilizing the structure of a journey to the past to discover the "Forgotten People" of the Bakhtiari. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Alberto Cavalcanti, 1926 and Jean Vigo, 1930</span> &bull; The city symphony was one of the first forms to become popular as conscious documentary filmmaking emerged in the 1920s. Via paradigms of Soviet montage and location photography these films explored the impacted urban environments that defined modernity. Cavalcanti's <em>Rien que les heures</em>, one of the earliest films in this genre, traces the relationship of Parisians to their city, while Vigo's <em>&Agrave; propos de Nice</em> contrasts the material life of the working class and the wealthy. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Stark Love</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Karl Brown, 1927</span> &bull; Although ostensibly a narrative film, director Karl Brown, a former cinematographer for D.W. Griffith, categorized Stark Love as part of the "actuality" genre: an attempt to create an authentic depiction of the lifestyle of the Appalachian people, a foreign culture to the film's urban audience. Brown shot on location in the Great Smoky Mountains and cast locals in every role to lend his film a greater air of realism. Stark Love effectively combines melodramatic storytelling with a realistic depiction of the Appalachian way of life and challenges notions of the documentary's objectivity towards its subject.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">John Grierson, 1929</span> &bull; Following the daily life of herring fisherman in the North Sea, <em>Drifters</em> illustrates the escalating industrialization of that business and its effect on workers. Director John Grierson marshals a panoply of filmmaking techniques drawn from his contemporaries, such as Sergei Eisenstein and Robert Flaherty, while eschewing the inherently dramatic for the mundane details of fishermen's daily lives. Oft cited as the catalyst for Britain's documentary tradition, <em>Drifters</em> is a moving display of temperance and humanity in the face of capitalist expansion, virtues that Grierson defines as uniquely British.  <span class="format">Archival 16mm</span></p></div>

In the 1930s, the island of Bali was an American cultural obsession, appearing as the setting of many films and becoming a popular tourist attraction. This exploitation film reflects that sentiment. French aristocrat Marquis Henry de la Falaise depicts Bali as an exotic paradise, revealing a personal connection to the island in his meticulous presentation of various Balinese dances and religious rituals. One of the last films recorded in two-color Technicolor, <em>Legong</em> is the ultimate demonstration of the documentary conceived as an arresting, escapist spectacle.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

In 1979, Grigori Aleksandrov, Eisenstein's friend and frequent collaborator, edited the existing footage with the aid of the director's own notes in an attempt to reproduce the intended vision as faithfully as possible. His reconstruction revealed that Eisenstein was creating a documentary with an historical scope, which would dwarf that of contemporaries. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Joris Ivens, 1937</span> &bull; The effects of the Spanish Civil War on the land and people of Spain are beautifully rendered in this film by Joris Ivens, one of the greatest documentary filmmakers. Given an incredible amount of access to the fighting's front lines, Ivens was able to present the daily struggle of citizens and soldiers in and around the town of Fuenteduena. His imagery and didacticism are augmented by narration written and performed by Ernest Hemingway. <em>The Spanish Earth</em> sees Ivens continuing to experiment with his documentary aesthetics, which one critic described as "an improvised hybrid of many filmic modes." <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>
