<h1> Spring 2009,  Thursday &bull; American Grit</h1>

<p class="seriesdesc">Post hippie urban angst, 1968-1973</p><a href="#movies">Skip to the movie listings</a>

<div class="series-essay">

<p>The years between 1968 and 1972 were perhaps the most misunderstood and improperly discussed era of Hollywood filmmaking, second only to the brief and very similar period of pre-code sound films, and saw some of the most profound and complex works of cinematic art emerge from the usually profits obsessed studio system.</p>

<p>This movement, which came to be known in part as The New American Cinema, was partially the result of the creation of the MPAA ratings system, which allowed for previously forbidden content to be included in motion pictures, and partially the effect of an increase in the popularity of various international "New Wave" movements.</p>

<p>The best known and most iconic film of this period, Easy Rider, resulted in a slew of subsequent American-made "Angry Young Man" films, acting as the US counterparts to great British works such as Lindsey Anderson's If&hellip; and numerous other Mod films that had been made in the preceding years. Easy Rider established both Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper as two of the movement's most prolific flag bearers.</p>

<p>Nicholson established himself through both his on and off-screen contributions during the period, co-writing and starring in Bob Rafelson's 1969 work Five Easy Pieces and directing the 1971 film Drive, He Said, the latter being one of the most unique anti Vietnam pictures of the period for its focus on small-town ethics instead of anti-war protests.</p>

<p>Vietnam played a major role in all areas of artistic culture and Peter Bogdanovich's seminal debut work Targets remains one of the finest critiques of post-war mental deterioration, juxtaposed against the drastic changes taking place in Hollywood filmmaking.</p>

<p>By 1970 director Frank Perry had become one of the most prolific voices in cinema with his attacks on the male-dominated nouveau riche in films such as David &amp; Lisa and The Swimmer, but it wasn't until that year's Diary of a Mad Housewife that he perfected his harsh yet subtle approach to social criticism with his attack on the male dominated nouveau riche. Two years later he would direct what is still his most affecting film, Play It As It Lays, a rich Antonioni inspired stream of consciousness masterpiece.</p>

<p>Easy Rider not only launched the American Angry-Young-Man film, but provided a powerful commentary on the late 60s drug cartel, or lackthereof. Bill L. Norton's 1972 work, Cisco Pike, takes a more humanizing look at the "dealers" and is one of the most powerful anti-police statements of the time.</p>

<p>Though the era was filled with anti-authoritarian sentiment, Richard Fleishcher's rare humanizing look at law enforcement, The New Centurions, takes a bold step in through claiming "cops are people too."</p>

<p>Though usually relegated to lower budget and exploitation films, sexual liberation was a common theme in many American films of the late 60s. Just as was the case in Paul Mazursky's cynical outsider-looking-in at swinging culture film, Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice, which became one of the greatest commercial successes of 1969 despite its seemingly anti liberal philosophies.</p>

<p>Feminism became the banner liberation movement of the 70s, but in the mid to late 1960s, racism was easily the greatest American issue in American life next to the Vietnam War. It was not until 1969 that a black filmmaker (Gordon Parks) directed a motion picture for a major studio, but it was Melvin Van Peebles who truly became the cinematic voice of racial oppression. His debut Hollywood film, The Watermelon Man, despite its light and comedic pacing, is still one of the most harsh looks at the degree to which racism was not only legally but culturally ingrained.</p>

<p>Though deemed cinematic fads at the time of their release and frequently dismissed by critics as attempts to cash in on short lived movements, these films and filmmakers played a crucial role in not only bringing novel aesthetic devices and storytelling styles to American screens, but opened up the eyes of era filmgoers to the social problems being experienced by so many who had been deemed not worthy of artistic investigation.

  <div class="title"><p>Easy Rider</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Dennis Hopper, 1969</span> &bull; Dennis Hopper's iconographic <em>Easy Rider</em> is the ultimate testament to everything that was a failure in every so-called revolution which occurred in the 1960s. Peter Fonda and Hopper have just finished a drug run and are now on their way to Mardi Gras, but their soul searching trip quickly becomes a moral reminder of everything that is still awry in the newly "liberated" United States. Nothing short of a masterpiece, <em>Easy Rider</em> is one of the crucial works of late 60s American cinema, sumptuously photographed by Laszlo Kovacs and featuring what is still considered one of Jack Nicholson's career performances.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 9 at 7:00 &bull; 90m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Targets</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Peter Bogdonovich, 1968</span> &bull; Peter Bogdonivich's <em>Targets</em> is a psych-drama thriller which doubles as a biopic of the later life of actor Boris Karloff. Set in a lonely-looking Los Angeles, <em>Targets</em> moves back and forth between the mundane life of a once popular horror icon, Byron Orlock (a thinly veiled version of Karloff ) and that of a Vietnam vet sniper who happens to choose the drivein where Orlock's latest film is being premiered as his next target zone. Though comparable to the previous year's <em>Point Blank</em> in its cynical look at L.A., <em>Targets</em> is more a tome of hopelessness set against a violence-obsessed world. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 16 at 7:00 &bull; 98m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Five Easy Pieces</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Bob Rafelson, 1969</span> &bull; Crazed loneliness was a common theme in American cinema of the late 60s and early 70s. Films centering on everyday loners-run-amok who intentionally separated themselves from the civilized world constantly filled half of a drive-in double feature. Bob Rafelson's first foray into "serious" filmmaking became one of the keynote studies of late 60s American life. Jack Nicholson plays Bobby, a drifter from a wealthy family who became disillusioned by his "daily routine." When he becomes equally bored with his carefree lower-class lifestyle, he decides to return to his family, but has anything in him changed?  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Paul Mazursky, 1969</span> &bull; One of the many short- lived cultural fads of the late 60s was swinging. Paul Mazursky's cinematic capitalizing on the swinger lifestyle, <em>Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice</em>, is less a morality play than a sarcastic comment on the phoniness of such "liberating" movements. Bob and Carol are a happily married couple who, after attending an obligatory therapy session, are led to believe they will find satisfaction through sex with other couples. They enlist their friends Ted and Alice and soon embark on a journey of sexual awakening, only to realize that freeing their bodies is much easier than opening their minds.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Play it as it Lays</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Frank Perry, 1972</span> &bull; Though director Frank Perry was best known for his play-like character studies, <em>Play It As It Lays</em> is a remarkable divergence from that style and remains one of the most thought-provoking avantgarde works to emerge from the studio system. A part structuralist, part stream-ofconsciousness depiction of the deterioration of actress Maria Lang, <em>Lays</em> is an account of the drug-infused egotism that plagued early 70s Hollywood. Perry and screenwriter Joan Didion are sympathetic toward the unstable Lang, but <em>Lays</em> frequently reminds the audience that only she is to blame for her own downfall. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Diary of a Mad Housewife</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Frank Perry, 1970</span> &bull; Although most counterculture reactionary films of the late 60s and early 70s were centered on young men, Frank Perry's scathing look at a "liberated" woman in a man's world remains one of cinema's harshest critiques of gender inequality. Carrie Snodgrass stars as Tina, an upper-class New York housewife whose domineering husband has reduced her to being his personal servant and entertainer. While at a party, she meets and soon begins having an affair with a "free thinking" artist named George; however, her illusion of bliss is short-lived. Tina's search for freedom is simply another road to subjugation. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>The Watermelon Man</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Melvin Van Peebles, 1970</span> &bull; <em>The Watermelon Man</em> was only the second feature from a black filmmaker to be produced by a Hollywood studio. A brutal social farce, the film follows a middle class, married white man who, for reasons unknown, wakes up black one morning. Soon the slightly racist protagonist is faced with the harsh effects of his new skin color as he loses his job, his family, and his social standing. Though Peebles' subsequent film, <em>Sweet Sweeback</em>, gained him international acclaim, <em>The Watermelon Man</em> remains his most thought-provoking work, as well as a strong and sarcastic comment on our supposed era of tolerance. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 21 at 7:00 &bull; 95m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Drive, He Said</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Jack Nicholson, 1971</span> &bull; Actor Jack Nicholson's directorial debut (although he worked on Roger Corman's The Terror) takes place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest and follows the social awakening of a college basketball star. In contrast to most anti-Vietnam films, Nicholson's look at the war and its effects on "everyday folks" is much less interested in the ethics of drafting or social activism, but rather functions as a poignant character-driven drama. Advertised as "the disenchantment of the All-American jock," <em>Drive, He Said</em> provides a glimpse into the lives of small-town America so often ignored in early 70s filmmaking. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 28 at 7:00 &bull; 104m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>The New Centurions</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Richard Fleischer, 1972</span> &bull; In an era where most films and filmmakers were quick to demonize American police forces as brutal and corrupt, Richard Fleischer's <em>The New Centurions</em> is a rare humanizing look at a group whose work is so often considered inhuman. Stacy Keach is a young rookie cop with ambitions of changing the corrupt LAPD, but who begins to realize, after being paired with a tired and aging veteran, George C. Scott, that his ideals of performing effective and honest police work are hopeless. Nevertheless, he perseveres, costing him his life and marriage.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>June 4 at 7:00 &bull; 93m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Cisco Pike</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Bill Norton, 1972</span> &bull; Made at the height of Kris Kristofferson's singing career, Bill L. Norton's <em>Cisco Pike</em> is a moral fable pitting well-intentioned country singer Cisco Pike (Kristofferson) against a self-hating violent cop (Gene Hackman) who is determined to bust Pike on drug charges. Director Norton captures the ambiance of early 70s urban drug culture with incredible lyricism, and Kristofferson's original score augments the film's outstanding depictions of lonely sprawl. Harry Dean Stanton co-stars as Cisco's ill-fated best friend, and both Karen Black and Warhol superstar Viva appear as the film's pseudo-femme fatales.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>
