  <div class="showings-length"><p>March 30 at 7:00 &bull; 101m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>The Bride and I</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Pai Ching-Jui, 1968</span> &bull; Pai Ching-Jui was one of the most important Taiwanese filmmakers of the sixties and seventies. So <em>The Bride and I</em> serves both as a fine exemplar of the romantic comedies popular at the time, and as a wonderfully self-conscious iteration of the same, as Pai tests the limitations of the genre. The narrative, which concerns a young couple's attempts to reconcile their arranged marriage, engages a theme that would develop into a central concern of New Taiwanese filmmakers, especially Edward Yang: the obstinacy of Confucian forms of social organization in a culture undergoing capitalist transformation. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Frank Hurley, 1918</span> &bull; Already a world renowned explorer by 1914, Ernest Shackleton set out to be the first to cross Antarctica by way of the South Pole. Frank Hurley accompanied the crew to create a film of the explorer's hopeful milestone. Unfortunately, Shackleton's ship the Endurance became stuck in an ice flow, stranding the crew for months. Artfully photographed by Hurley, the film chronicles the day to day tasks of the crew as they persevere in this harsh environment. <em>South</em> is a great adventure story, but is most impressive when recording the minutiae of an explorer's existence. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Bringing Up Baby</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Howard Hawks, 1938</span> &bull; The screwball comedy reached delirium, and the limits of its logic, in this Howard Hawks masterpiece about a paleontologist who is subjected to a chain of hilarious identity crises by a freewheeling society gal. As surely as Grant embodies Hawks's configuration of the eternal male, a feckless geek seeking Nature's order, Katharine Hepburn is the eternal female, an impulsive feline capriciously performing Nature's will. While this deeply idiosyncratic film failed to resonate with audiences at the time, perhaps due to its near hermetic pessimism, today it is widely held as the quintessence of its genre. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Easy Rider</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Dennis Hopper, 1969</span> &bull; Dennis Hopper's iconographic <em>Easy Rider</em> is the ultimate testament to everything that was a failure in every so-called revolution which occurred in the 1960s. Peter Fonda and Hopper have just finished a drug run and are now on their way to Mardi Gras, but their soul searching trip quickly becomes a moral reminder of everything that is still awry in the newly "liberated" United States. Nothing short of a masterpiece, <em>Easy Rider</em> is one of the crucial works of late 60s American cinema, sumptuously photographed by Laszlo Kovacs and featuring what is still considered one of Jack Nicholson's career performances.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Glen or Glenda</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Ed Wood, 1953</span> &bull; The legendary Ed Wood offers this bizarrely incompetent attempt to explain his own penchant for transvestitism&mdash;particularly for angora sweaters. A morphine-addled Bela Legosi, spewing out nonsense in an inexplicable role as a scientist "pulling the strings" of the action, is the best actor of the cast, which even includes Wood himself as the titular Glen/Glenda. There is no discernible structure, and stock footage makes up a good chunk of the actual screen time. Yet despite his lack of technical or narrative skill, Wood's obvious sincerity is what makes the film so endearing. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Slumdog Millionaire</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Danny Boyle, 2008</span> &bull; Through cleverly bridged flashbacks, <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> explores the Dickensian tale of Jamal Malik, the young underdog on the hot seat of India's <em>Who Wants to be a Millionaire?</em>. The film encourages us to identify with the charismatic hero and his many sidekicks, and to enjoy its smorgasbord of romance, suspense, comedy and drama. But beneath the Bollywood glamour and A.R. Rahman's lively score is an unflinching look at Mumbai's present-day street life, and Boyle does not let us ignore this stark reality. Recipient of 8 Oscars, including Best Picture. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Quantum of Solace</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Marc Forster, 2008</span> &bull; In keeping with Casino Royale's aim to remodel the franchise, this latest Bond actually follows its antecedent as a direct sequel. Pursuing those responsible for his lover's death, 007 uncovers Quantum, an information age S.P.E.C.T.R.E., whose lead agent poses as an environmentalist! The film strikes a dour tone telegraphed by Daniel Craig's chiseled features and novel disinterest in his heroine. Gone is Pierce Brosnan's self-reflexive humor, which blithely acknowledged the character as a cultural anachronism. This Bond is contemporary, righteous and deathly serious. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Record of a Tenement Gentleman</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1947</span> &bull; When a young boy is apparently abandoned by his father, a tenement owner brings him home, and convinces one of his renters, an embittered old woman, to take the child temporarily. While at first resistant to the boy, and eager to rid herself of him, she contradicts what seems to be her character and quickly forms such a close relationship with him that she comes to consider him her own. Even while asserting the possibility for the renewal of human kindness, <em>Record of a Tenement Gentleman</em> presents a stark picture of the desolation and breakdown of traditional familial bonds in postwar Japan. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Growing Up</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Chen Kun-Hou, 1983</span> &bull; One of three films that ignited the New Taiwan Cinema, <em>Growing Up</em>, directed by Chen Kun-hou and written by Hou Hsiao-hsien, was a significant commercial and critical success, inspiring many to produce works in its vein. The narrative focuses on the defining events of a student's adolescence&mdash;his mother's remarriage, his high school shenanigans, and his first romance&mdash;while concomitantly the style emphasized understatement in its attentiveness to character psychology and restraint in its evocation of social issues, such as the relationship between Mainland Chinese and Native Taiwanese.  <span class="format">Archival 16mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Merian C. Cooper & Ernest B. Shoedsack, 1925</span> &bull; Inspired by Robert Flatherty's <em>Nanook of the North</em>, Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack, sought their own adventure to film and produced <em>Grass</em>, one of the earliest ethnographic documentaries. Grass follows the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia (now Iran), an estimated 50,000 people plus countless herds of livestock, as they travel across mountains and rivers to new pastures. In their first film together, Cooper and Shoedsack explore the narrative framing possibilities of the documentary, utilizing the structure of a journey to the past to discover the "Forgotten People" of the Bakhtiari. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>The Awful Truth</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Leo McCarey, 1937</span> &bull; A landmark in Grant's career, this comedy of manners, thought to have been heavily improvised by Leo McCarey, is the film credited with creating the star's persona&mdash;bemused, elegant, and suave, but above all light as air. Grant and Irene Dunne play Jerry and Lucy Warriner, a high society couple who divorce under a cloud of mutual suspicion, only to discover they still love each other. What could easily have occasioned sentimental moralizing is redeemed in McCarey's commitment to illuminating a couple's attempt to regain the simplicity of romantic love within a sophisticated and modern society.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 9 at 7:00 &bull; 90m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Targets</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Peter Bogdonovich, 1968</span> &bull; Peter Bogdonivich's <em>Targets</em> is a psych-drama thriller which doubles as a biopic of the later life of actor Boris Karloff. Set in a lonely-looking Los Angeles, <em>Targets</em> moves back and forth between the mundane life of a once popular horror icon, Byron Orlock (a thinly veiled version of Karloff ) and that of a Vietnam vet sniper who happens to choose the drivein where Orlock's latest film is being premiered as his next target zone. Though comparable to the previous year's <em>Point Blank</em> in its cynical look at L.A., <em>Targets</em> is more a tome of hopelessness set against a violence-obsessed world. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Robert Woodburn, 1956</span> &bull; Widely considered by Doc programmers to be the most amazing discovery we have ever made, this country-and-western musical about popcorn, produced as far as we can tell by a semiprofessional Kansas City television crew, has a screenplay by Robert Altman. Yes, that Robert Altman. The plot has something to do with a popcorn manufacturer named Thaddeus Pinwhistle, a crooked PR man named Waldo Crummit, a singer named Lillian Gravelguard, etc. There are delightful songs about balloons and traveling to Mars, sometimes performed while the singers are pelted with popcorn.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Milk</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Gus Van Sant, 2008</span> &bull; As the nation's first openly gay elected official, Harvey Milk, like Rosa Parks, was the right person at the right time. Milk's success at spearheading the defeat of Proposition 6 is a historical rebuke to us, 30 years on with the passing of last year's Proposition "H8". Commencing at Milk's assassination, Van Sant's biopic proceeds in a non-linear narrative progression, anchored by a recording Milk made a few months before his death. The direction brilliantly evokes the seventies through its seamless incorporation of historical footage throughout the film. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Changeling</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Clint Eastwood, 2008</span> &bull; Clint Eastwood's sprawling and complex period piece, based on the true case of a kidnapped Los Angeles boy, intricately and brilliantly weaves a murder mystery, an account of police corruption and brutality, and a fierce indictment of mental health institutions into an extremely fast paced two and a half hours. Distinguished by an outstanding Oscar nominated performance by Angelina Jolie and a fierce supporting cast, which includes Jeffrey Donovan in a career performance, Eastwood proves he is still one of the most important filmmakers in Hollywood today. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 12 at 7:00 &bull; 108m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Late Spring</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1949</span> &bull; Setsuko Hara, with her inimitable charm and warmth, stars as Noriko, a young woman in her late twenties who is pressured by everyone in her life to settle down and get married. Noriko, however, has no interest in doing so. She prefers instead to stay single and care for her widowed father (Chishu Ryu). One of Ozu's most powerful family dramas, <em>Late Spring</em> explores poignantly and carefully conflicting notions of self-sacrifice, obligation, and personal desire in the shifting postwar social landscape, along with the sorrows and tensions that naturally arise from such notions. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Taipei Story</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Edward Yang, 1985</span> &bull; Striking a fiercely different tone from the New Taiwan films that had preceded it, most of which depicted small town life and small time dramas, Edward Yang's second feature mounted a ruthless critique of urban culture during Taipei's economic boom. Simultaneously, the film inaugurated Yang's sustained interest in the metropolis as an impacted social landscape. With Hou Hsiao-hsien himself assuming the dramatic lead, and regular Hou collaborator Chu T'ien-wen penning the script, <em>Taipei Story</em> is emblematic of the collaborative, experimental spirit that briefly defined New Taiwan Cinema's early years.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Alberto Cavalcanti, 1926 and Jean Vigo, 1930</span> &bull; The city symphony was one of the first forms to become popular as conscious documentary filmmaking emerged in the 1920s. Via paradigms of Soviet montage and location photography these films explored the impacted urban environments that defined modernity. Cavalcanti's <em>Rien que les heures</em>, one of the earliest films in this genre, traces the relationship of Parisians to their city, while Vigo's <em>&Agrave; propos de Nice</em> contrasts the material life of the working class and the wealthy. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>

Like many of Cukor's leads, Grant faces the duality of his own way of life, and is forced to choose between the smothering stability of wealth and tradition, and the dizzying promiscuity of a nonconformist, high roller existence.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Bob Rafelson, 1969</span> &bull; Crazed loneliness was a common theme in American cinema of the late 60s and early 70s. Films centering on everyday loners-run-amok who intentionally separated themselves from the civilized world constantly filled half of a drive-in double feature. Bob Rafelson's first foray into "serious" filmmaking became one of the keynote studies of late 60s American life. Jack Nicholson plays Bobby, a drifter from a wealthy family who became disillusioned by his "daily routine." When he becomes equally bored with his carefree lower-class lifestyle, he decides to return to his family, but has anything in him changed?  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Norman McLeod, 1933</span> &bull; Paramount's 1933 version takes Lewis Carroll's already strange tale even further with its bizarre all-star cast: W.C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty, Gary Cooper sporting a fake nose as the White Knight, Ned Sparks as the Caterpillar, Edward Everett Horton as the Mad Hatter, and Cary Grant wearing a turtleneck and, inexplicably, a horse's head as the Mock Turtle. The Fleischer studios provide an animated "The Walrus and the Carpenter" segment. Filled with special effect sequences that are both impressive and terrifying, this is a film surreal enough to please Charles Dodgson himself. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Tomas Alfredson, 2008</span> &bull; This Swedish vampire film is an intelligent movie whose sweetness lingers long after the curtains close. One can't help but coo over undead Eli and Oskar, her prematurely downtrodden boy companion, as they deal with the tricky business of feeding a pre-teen vampire in a small, reserved town. Squeamish viewers may begrudge the authentic display of gore, but this is foremost a story about learning to trust others during our fragile prepubescent years. Don't judge Oskar's complicity too harshly. What wouldn't you have done for your middle school crush? <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Stephen Daldry, 2008</span> &bull; This adaptation of a 1995 novel by Bernhard Schlink constructs its story in flashback. A young boy and an older woman (Kate Winslet) engage in a passionate affair in post-War Germany. Decades later, the boy, now a lawyer (Ralph Fiennes), discovers his former lover was a concentration camp guard and is on trial for war crimes. Now, the young man must reconcile his lingering feelings with the horrible knowledge of his inamorata's past. Under Stephen Daldry's artful direction, the interweaving of an erotic affair with the Holocaust's brutalities appears natural and seamless. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

This Noriko is a feistier incarnation, willing to go along with her family's wishes, but only on her own terms. Rather than accepting the matches presented to her, she makes her own decision. Early Summer engages all Ozu's classic postwar themes, particularly exploring the phenomenon of attitudinal change across generations, with the fast-paced transformation of Japan's 1950s economic boom serving as backdrop. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

If Yang's films consistently exploded the New Taiwan Cinema's formal parameters, as defined by Growing Up, Hou's refined and epitomized them. His work came to signify the movement entire, exerting an immediate influence on the next generation, including China's Jia Zhang-ke, whose distanced set-ups in Platform (2000), also autobiographical, are difficult to imagine without Dust in the Wind. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Karl Brown, 1927</span> &bull; Although ostensibly a narrative film, director Karl Brown, a former cinematographer for D.W. Griffith, categorized Stark Love as part of the "actuality" genre: an attempt to create an authentic depiction of the lifestyle of the Appalachian people, a foreign culture to the film's urban audience. Brown shot on location in the Great Smoky Mountains and cast locals in every role to lend his film a greater air of realism. Stark Love effectively combines melodramatic storytelling with a realistic depiction of the Appalachian way of life and challenges notions of the documentary's objectivity towards its subject.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

But when Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur), an itinerant nightclub singer, invades this barroom scene, Carter's painstakingly preserved sense of fatalism faces dissolution, as he begins to understand love. Acclaimed for its muscularly staged flight sequences, in these moments of unadorned poetry Only Angels Have Wings may represent the purest expression of the Hawksian worldview.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

Paul Mazursky's cinematic capitalizing on the swinger lifestyle, <em>Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice</em>, is less a morality play than a sarcastic comment on the phoniness of such "liberating" movements. Bob and Carol are a happily married couple who, after attending an obligatory therapy session, are led to believe they will find satisfaction through sex with other couples. They enlist their friends Ted and Alice and soon embark on a journey of sexual awakening, only to realize that freeing their bodies is much easier than opening their minds.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

The jawdroppingly insane plan they enact, followed by their triumphant victory march, has led more than one reviewer to compare the film to Hitler Youth propaganda. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1956</span> &bull; Early Spring explores a familiar drudgery of postwar Japan&mdash;the day-to-day experience of the average office worker. In his 1952 <em>Ikiru</em>, Akira Kurosawa offered an alternative vision of the same, but one more sentimental and moralizing than what Ozu created here. The plot centers around an illicit love affair between two workers in a typically anonymous office, but story isn't all that important. Rather, the film becomes meaningful and relevant by its effective evocation of a tedious mode of being. A shining example of Ozu's subtlety, <em>Early Spring</em> is an interesting departure from his widely viewed family dramas. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

The narrative chronicles the experience of Taiwan's transplanted mainland communities seeking security at the dawn of the 60s, and the failure of Confucian morality to comprehend a changed world. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

In 1979, Grigori Aleksandrov, Eisenstein's friend and frequent collaborator, edited the existing footage with the aid of the director's own notes in an attempt to reproduce the intended vision as faithfully as possible. His reconstruction revealed that Eisenstein was creating a documentary with an historical scope, which would dwarf that of contemporaries. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Howard Hawks, 1949</span> &bull; As implied by its title, this WWII comedy enacts a dementedly self-conscious play on male humiliation. Assuming the role of a Free French popinjay who marries an all American servicewoman (Ann Sheridan), Grant must earn the military's official "war bride" status to attain an emigration visa to the States. After a string of derisive mishaps and misidentifications, all typically screwball but endowed here with the same sense of discomfort and disillusionment that would define much postwar auteur cinema, the picture famously culminates with Grant donning an asinine blond wig to fool Navy bureaucracy. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>

In contrast to most anti-Vietnam films, Nicholson's look at the war and its effects on "everyday folks" is much less interested in the ethics of drafting or social activism, but rather functions as a poignant character-driven drama. Advertised as "the disenchantment of the All-American jock," <em>Drive, He Said</em> provides a glimpse into the lives of small-town America so often ignored in early 70s filmmaking. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

Sweetly comedic, <em>Late Autumn</em> is another beautiful meditation on changing human relationships and the tumults that rock small lives, even as tranquility and a passive acceptance of these define the film's aesthetic. As his career progresses into its final stage, the director's favorite themes have not grown tired. Rather, their staying power and boundless capacity to move audiences reaffirm the depth and complexity of Ozu's artistic project. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

The third installment in a trilogy of historical comedies dubbed the "Nativist Series" and directed by the important, if relatively obscure Wang Tung, <em>Hill of No Return</em> is a whimsical account of Taiwan's native proletariat, in contrast to Yang and Hou's more sober pictures, which concern the lives of displaced mainlanders and Taiwanese literati.  <span class="format">Archival 16mm</span></p></div>

Shot in Technicolor on location in Paris, which Donen exploits beautifully, this farcical suspense thriller is Hitchcock-lite in the best sense, elegantly photographed, cleverly plotted, and exuding an atmosphere of impish mischief telegraphed in its stars' tongue-in-cheek repartee and Henry Mancini's playful score. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

Stacy Keach is a young rookie cop with ambitions of changing the corrupt LAPD, but who begins to realize, after being paired with a tired and aging veteran, George C.

The incredible sound design by Lynch and Alan Splet is a character of its own&mdash;combining bizarre drones with Fats Waller organ music, and climaxing in the haunting song of the Lady in the Radiator. <span class="format"> DVD</span></p></div>

The sense of loss evoked by this swan song's goodbyes runs particularly deep, as we experience not only the dissolution of a standard of relationships, or a particular cultural moment, but of Yasujiro Ozu himself, and his camera's meditative gaze. One is left yearning, not just for a bygone era and lost sense of constancy, but over whether we will again be able to accept loss as this artist's unique cinematic language has enabled us to do. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Steven Soderbergh, 2008</span> &bull; The first part of Steven Soderbergh's epic is triumphant, depicting Che Guevara (Benicio del Toro in a career performance) on his ascent to glory during the Cuban Revolution, and rise to prominence as an international icon. At Fidel Castro's right hand, Che becomes an inspirational guerrilla leader, caring for the wounded, training soldiers, and speaking before the United Nations. The treatment of the subject oscillates between electrifying reportage, carefully reenacting historical scenes, and lyrical contemplation, arresting the narrative to ponder the climate of Che's times. <em>Che</em>'s second chapter finds the man leaving his family to lead a band of rebels in the Bolivian jungle in an effort to spark Marxist revolutions across South America. Tragically, Che fails to grasp the geopolitical dynamics of the region, and cannot convince the people of Bolivia of his sincerity. Sheer passion drives him to persevere, despite being outnumbered by both Bolivian and American forces. Soderbergh's hyperrealism plunges us into an asthmatic Guevara's dire final months as he and his tattered forces fight desperately for an already lost cause. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
