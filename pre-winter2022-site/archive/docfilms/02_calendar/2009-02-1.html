<div class="series-essay">

<p>Even a brief overview of Taiwan cinema in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century must take into account its multilingual context. The majority of films produced in Taiwan in the 1950s and early 1960s were in Taiwan's native Southern Min language, and represented locally popular genres such as opera films and romantic comedies. By the 1960s Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party, the sole ruling party since its ousting from the Mainland by Mao Zeodong's Communist Party, was aggressively enforcing the teaching of Mandarin in schools and the use of Mandarin in cinema and other media. Launched by the state-owned Central Motion Pictures Corporation (CMPC), so-called ``healthy realism'' became the dominant genre. Mostly set in rural Taiwan, these films imagined a harmonious agrarian society, a vision which was often well-received by local audiences, but also represented the ideological whitewash of a repressive government. </p>

<p>Pressured by foreign competition, mostly from the Hong Kong industry, CMPC sought to diversify their production, experimenting with costume melodramas, comedies, and musicals. Pai Ching-jui's romantic comedy The Bride and I (1968) well exemplifies this attempt to compete with glitzier foreign products by toning down ideological content. One of the highlights of this important filmmaker's career and a box office hit, this delightfully self-reflexive work calls attention to the constraints that both political and commercial demands imposed on filmmakers at the time, thus combining light comedy and veiled cultural critique. </p>

<p>With the death of Chiang Kai-shek and the diplomatic isolation that followed the 1971 UN decision to recognize the People's Republic of China, the 1970s marked a dim, claustrophobic period in Taiwanese history, where cookie-cutter escapism prevailed, mostly in the form of adaptations of popular romance novels. But by the 1980s, facing ever-increasing competition from Hong Kong and Hollywood, CMPC inaugurated a ``newcomer policy'' aimed at attracting new talent to the local film industry. This institutional support was crucial for the emergence of the New Taiwan Cinema, whose exponents were given carte blanche, as well as the full wealth of the company's subsidies. Economic imperatives had at last superseded political ones, as the Nationalist Party gradually lost its grip on the country's imagination.</p>

<p>In 1980, Wu Nien-jen, a precocious novelist, found himself hired as a creative supervisor to reinvigorate CMPC's productions. The resulting project In Our Time (1982) inaugurated the New Taiwan Cinema with its quotidian tales of childhood mortification, sexual awakening, and urban maladjustment. It also occasioned the first film from a young former journeyman of television, Edward Yang. But it was Growing Up (Chen Kun-hou, 1983) that first attracted broad critical and popular attention to the movement. Penned by Hou Hsiao-hsien, eventually the movement's most prominent filmmaker, in his first of many collaborations (nearly every work of his career) with another novelist, a young woman named Chu T'ien-wen, Growing Up established some of the movement's key stylistic approaches and narrative concerns, with its subdued manner in relating the story of an adolescent boy grappling with everyday pangs amid Taiwan's fraught provincial context. The same year saw the release of The Sandwich Man, Wu Nien-jen's second omnibus film consisting of three shorts including Hou Hsiao-hsien's first personal project as a director. It was immediately hailed as a ``completely new start for the Chinese cinema of Taiwan.'' </p>

<p>Most of the New Taiwan filmmakers, including Hou, Wu, Chu, and Yang were born in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and raised under a military dictatorship with a pro-Mandarin, anti-communist ideology at its core. They witnessed the economic take-off of the 1960s with its rapid social and political transformations. Each represented a different stratum of Taiwan society, and thus a different attitude towards its problems. For their parts the two writers Wu Nien-jen and Chu T'ien-wen were natives, and respectively represented that society's proletariat and literati cultures. On the other hand, the two filmmakers Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang both hailed from the Mainland, their families having fled the Chinese Civil War. The former's clan was rural and working class of the Hakka, a Han subgroup from Southern China, while the latter's family was urban bourgeois from Shanghai, settling in Taipei. </p>

<p>These four individuals outline a representative cadre of a larger group, some trained at home and some abroad. Drawing inspiration from the Hong Kong New Wave or international art cinema, or shaped by their work in television and the popular film industry, they emphasized a naturalistic acting style, location photography, and everyday depictions of Taiwan. Perhaps most importantly, their films returned to the use of Southern Min as their spoken idiom.</p>

<p>Over the course of the decade, Hou Hsiao-hsien's films contemplated the space between the rural and the urban. The last in a series of coming of age stories, Dust in the Wind (1986) is illustrative of this trend and marks the culmination of Hou's early career. A loose adaptation of Wu Nien-jen's autobiography, the film depicts a young couple who leave their mining village to find work in the city. From the movie screen stretched above the village square to the urban theatre where the protagonists often meet, the film features scenes of film spectatorship that powerfully reflect the significance of cinema, and the city, in the imaginations of marginalized provincial folk. By Hou's next film Daughter of the Nile (1987), the pastoral landscape that sparked nostalgia in healthy realist cinema, and a quiet sense of unrest in Hou's earlier films, has dissolved before the cold, neon liquidity of Taipei, foreshadowing his preoccupation with postmodern temporal drift in more recent works such as Millennium Mambo (2001).</p>

<p>By contrast, the films of Edward Yang in this period, with one exception, were resolutely urban. Sometimes described as a ``moralist'' because many of his characters seemed in search of ethical frames of reference, Yang was certainly ruthless. In recounting how a successful young businesswoman sees her career perspectives dissolve and her relationship with her boyfriend (played by Hou Hsiao-hsien himself) fall apart, Taipei Story (1985) displays Yang's uncompromising critique of the middle-class with its dissection of its heroine's emotional fragility, vainly disguised behind the sunglasses she sports day and night. As she flees the past, her boyfriend idealistically clings to it, a Confucian rigidity toward which Yang bears still less patience. </p>

<p>In The Terrorizer (1986), Yang expanded this deconstructionist project, staging a collision of six characters across a post-industrial landscape, as a bored Eurasian teenager, convalescing in her apartment, implicates each of them in a monotonous pattern of reciprocal betrayals via a few well-placed prank calls. Famously characterized by Marxist scholar Fredric Jameson as the postmodern film, the film was likened by Yang himself to a puzzle where the pleasure lies in rearranging a multitude of relationships between characters, spaces, and genres. </p>

<p>As the decade came to a close, the lifting of martial law in 1987 allowed Hou and Yang to push these initial experiments in personal and social articulation even further, and to confront Taiwan's tortured history with even greater scope and honesty. Thus, in 1989 and 1991 respectively, they produced what many historians identify as the movement's finest works, as well as two of the greatest films ever made. </p>

<p>The first of these, based on a script by Wu Nien-jen and Chu T'ien-wen, was Hou Hsiao-hsien's A City of Sadness (1989), a consummately balanced attempt to encompass the traumatic events that shaped Taiwan's national identity in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. The first film to openly address the February 28 incident of 1947, when popular protests were violently suppressed by the Nationalist government, claiming the lives of some 8,000 to 10,000 native Taiwanese, it was also one of the first films to contain significant sections in various local languages. Chronicling the desolation of a native clan during the transition between Japanese and Nationalist sovereignty, the picture takes a distanced gaze toward history, correlative to the silent eyes of the youngest of four brothers, a deaf-mute photographer, sensitively interpreted by a youthful Tony Leung. As official authority is metonymically conveyed though off-screen sounds or discreetly viewed signals (radio broadcasts, idle chatter, the sound of boots, a uniform), the camera keeps its eye on the domestic bustle within the homes of characters who pass in and out of its frame with a devastatingly mortal fluidity. Though these people leave behind a collection of fragmentary inscriptions &ndash; photographs, journals, scrawled notes, and letters &ndash; all grasping to evoke a traumatic history, they cannot reconstitute a univocal narrative, a task, which Hou leaves to us, and future generations.</p>

<p>Yang's own synoptic masterpiece, A Brighter Summer Day (1991) in some sense constituted a self-conscious follow-up to Hou's work. Where the former focuses on native struggles, Yang's evokes those of disaffected mainlanders attempting to settle themselves at the dawn of the 1960s amid the crumbling infrastructure of the Japanese occupation, the advances of American cultural imperialism, and the Nationalist government's protracted Communist witch hunt. As with so many New Taiwan films, partly autobiographical, this initiation story focuses on a group of very scared children as they fumble to make sense of a shell-shocked world with only their parents' outdated intellectual hardware to abet them. Its vaulted shots through arches, doorways, and windows, construct an uncertain cosmos where an encroaching darkness threatens the spatial integrity of the action, placing characters perpetually on the brink of further calamity. </p>

<p>We bring our series to a close with two late works, Wang Tung's Hill of No Return (1992) and Tsai Ming-liang's Rebels of the Neon God (1992). Wang Tung established himself as a set designer before turning to directing in the early 1980s. Hill of No Return is the third of his ``nativist trilogy,'' which includes Strawman (1987) and Banana Paradise (1989). Telling the story of two poor men who join the gold rush at the time of Japanese colonial rule in the 1920s, the film is a bawdy working class romp, inventively mixing humorous elements into a melodramatic plot. Indeed, Wang's near burlesque use of caricature struck a compelling contrast to the reserved naturalism of most New Taiwan Cinema, and particularly to the increasing mannerism and austerity that Hou and Yang had cultivated in their historical projects.</p>

<p>Rebels of the Neon God, Tsai's first film, embarks in a new direction entirely. Born in Malaysia and associated with the ``second phase'' of the New Taiwan Cinema, Tsai had emerged as an avant-garde playwright in the early 1980s and worked for television before starting his career as a film director. His works display thematic and stylistic incongruity, staging a critique of fantasies of belonging. In Rebels, petty young thieves cruise the malls and arcades of a decaying Taipei robbing public phones' coin boxes, while a rebellious student named Xiaokang, believed by his mother to be the ``Neon God'', lolls in his bedroom stabbing cockroaches with his compass. The hoodlums and Xiaokang are brought together by an inexplicable incident, after which Xiaokang seeks revenge. If the plot sounds thin, and a little surreal, this is because Tsai is attempting to evoke a physical condition more than a coherent narrative. Remarkable for its ethnographic look at inner Taipei folk beliefs and rituals, this film also may have signaled the impending dissolution of the entire movement as its filmmakers were forced into independence, seeking international backing for increasingly esoteric projects.

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Pai Ching-Jui, 1968</span> &bull; Pai Ching-Jui was one of the most important Taiwanese filmmakers of the sixties and seventies. So <em>The Bride and I</em> serves both as a fine exemplar of the romantic comedies popular at the time, and as a wonderfully self-conscious iteration of the same, as Pai tests the limitations of the genre. The narrative, which concerns a young couple's attempts to reconcile their arranged marriage, engages a theme that would develop into a central concern of New Taiwanese filmmakers, especially Edward Yang: the obstinacy of Confucian forms of social organization in a culture undergoing capitalist transformation. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Growing Up</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Chen Kun-Hou, 1983</span> &bull; One of three films that ignited the New Taiwan Cinema, <em>Growing Up</em>, directed by Chen Kun-hou and written by Hou Hsiao-hsien, was a significant commercial and critical success, inspiring many to produce works in its vein. The narrative focuses on the defining events of a student's adolescence&mdash;his mother's remarriage, his high school shenanigans, and his first romance&mdash;while concomitantly the style emphasized understatement in its attentiveness to character psychology and restraint in its evocation of social issues, such as the relationship between Mainland Chinese and Native Taiwanese.  <span class="format">Archival 16mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Taipei Story</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Edward Yang, 1985</span> &bull; Striking a fiercely different tone from the New Taiwan films that had preceded it, most of which depicted small town life and small time dramas, Edward Yang's second feature mounted a ruthless critique of urban culture during Taipei's economic boom. Simultaneously, the film inaugurated Yang's sustained interest in the metropolis as an impacted social landscape. With Hou Hsiao-hsien himself assuming the dramatic lead, and regular Hou collaborator Chu T'ien-wen penning the script, <em>Taipei Story</em> is emblematic of the collaborative, experimental spirit that briefly defined New Taiwan Cinema's early years.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Hou Hsiao-hsien, 1986</span> &bull; This film about provincial adolescents migrating to the city is the summation of the retrospective stylistics and autobiographical situations that dominate the first phase of Hou Hsiaohsien's oeuvre. If Yang's films consistently exploded the New Taiwan Cinema's formal parameters, as defined by Growing Up, Hou's refined and epitomized them. His work came to signify the movement entire, exerting an immediate influence on the next generation, including China's Jia Zhang-ke, whose distanced set-ups in Platform (2000), also autobiographical, are difficult to imagine without Dust in the Wind. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Edward Yang, 1986</span> &bull; <em>The Terrorizer</em> elaborated Yang's ambition to depart the structural limitations and narrowly domestic concerns of the New Taiwan Cinema. Via an intricate plot, interweaving the vectors of three couples tormented by an anonymous prank caller, and a poetic use of scenic framing, creating the sense of an oppressively circumscribed architectural whole, Yang envisions Taipei's violent interpersonal relationships as the emanations of greater global maladies and competing ideological discourses, a way of seeing that led Marxist scholar Fredric Jameson to call this work the essential postmodern film.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Daughter of the Nile</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Hou Hsiao-hsien, 1987</span> &bull; Hou's most obscure film, a transitional work that is rarely discussed and even more rarely screened, <em>Daughter of the Nile</em> nevertheless represents an exhilarating anticipation of the director's later masterpiece <em>Millennium Mambo</em> (2001). Both examine Taipei's youth culture, each elucidating the itinerant existence of a twenty-something party girl (here played by Taiwan's most renowned eighties pop singer). And similar to Hou's hypnotic exploration of Taipei clubs in the latter, Nile is punctuated with bewitching interludes, such as a nighttime motorcycle ride and beach bonfire.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>A City of Sadness</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Hou Hsiao-hsien, 1989</span> &bull; The greatest film to emerge from the New Taiwan Cinema, this historical epic about the desolation visited upon a native Taiwanese clan over the course of the White Terror, when Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) imprisoned or executed some 140,000 Taiwanese for dissidence real and perceived, proceeds in half-defined spans of narration, allowing us only a tenuous grasp of history in its making. Similarly deprived of the agency to determine their fate, Hou's characters cannot but endure catastrophe, while fumbling to adequately articulate their experience of time.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

The narrative chronicles the experience of Taiwan's transplanted mainland communities seeking security at the dawn of the 60s, and the failure of Confucian morality to comprehend a changed world. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

The third installment in a trilogy of historical comedies dubbed the "Nativist Series" and directed by the important, if relatively obscure Wang Tung, <em>Hill of No Return</em> is a whimsical account of Taiwan's native proletariat, in contrast to Yang and Hou's more sober pictures, which concern the lives of displaced mainlanders and Taiwanese literati.  <span class="format">Archival 16mm</span></p></div>

The film's partial ethnography of a community of drifters, environed by urban decay, anticipated Hou's own languorous documents of youthful disaffection and Yang's zoological satires of a globalizing Taipei. Here, the spectacle of a truant stabbing a cockroach on his compass achieves cosmic resonance in a last ditch effort to articulate the folk amidst cultural congestion.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>
