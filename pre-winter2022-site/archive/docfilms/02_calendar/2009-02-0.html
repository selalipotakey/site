<div class="series-essay">

<p>While masterpieces are to be found among his prewar films, Yasujiro Ozu inarguably reached his peak in the postwar period, his innovative style leaving a distinctive legacy on cinema. While Tokyo Story remains by far the most celebrated of his films, considered by some critics the greatest film of all time, he made many others, diverse in their content and style, that are capable of standing as comparably great works in their own right. </p>

<p>Most remarkable about these pictures is the obstinacy of their style with its famous ``tatami shots'' and conscious disregard of Hollywood's traditional continuity principles, such at the 180 degree rule. As his career progressed, Ozu engaged a process of reduction &ndash; of camera movement, of plot, of the use of fades and dissolves, and much else that is counted among the standard tricks in a filmmaker's repertoire. Though it is a myth that Ozu never moved his camera past a certain point in his career, never again would he track for an obviously functional purpose, the technique now serving a purely rhythmic and tonal aim to establish a pace implicitly expressed in the rest of a sequence. The most immediate result of this postwar refinement was therefore an incredibly patient and compassionate accommodation of his actors, underscored by an acute sense of the rhythms of daily life. That we can channel this patience when we take in Ozu's greatest works without falling into a mode of uncritical acceptance is one of the great gifts he has left us. </p>

<p>The society that acts as backdrop to many of his films, the transitory, precarious world of postwar Japan, weighs its occupants down with the everyday impossibilities of the modern world &ndash; the growing pains of clashing values, changing notions of family, and the realization of the fundamentally impermanent nature of human existence. To sit acknowledging such a world as it is, and with a mood that often contains within it both a sad sense of sympathy and often a scathing sense of criticism, embodies an emotional dichotomy few films have enabled us to reconcile, but such has been one of the definitive achievements of Ozu's cinema. </p>

<p>Ozu designedly set himself apart from any comparable stylistics in the East or the West by constructing a durable grammar all his own, but today his growing reputation and increasing popularity rests on misleading and grossly simplified conceptions of that style and its possible antecedents. One example is the common claim that Ozu is the most Japanese of his contemporaries, by which most critics mean Kurosawa, and perhaps Naruse and Mizoguchi, a claim which not only rests on tired essentialist, and orientalist, notions of ``Japaneseness'', but blithely disregards the clear influence of Hollywood auteurs on Ozu, readily apparent in his visual and thematic invocations of major filmmakers like Ernst Lubitsch and Leo McCarey. </p>

<p>At the same time, in enthroning Ozu as a master of emotional restraint, "simplicity and reticence," or in focusing on Tokyo Story as a total encapsulation of Ozu's life project, much is ignored that might allow us a deeper, more nuanced appreciation of his work's complexities. The typical understanding of Ozu denies his whimsical, almost absurdist side, which bespeaks a deep cynicism and even bitterness toward social superficiality, as well as prejudices old and new. In the same vein, Ozu is often thought to have made the same film repeatedly, such that individual films can be considered mere reiterations of the same material, rather than reconsiderations of similar material worked across varying contexts. As with that of most artists, Ozu's oeuvre is rife with repetitions in plot, theme, and form, but just as important is the tremendous experimentation within these constraints, where each successive film seems to be working parallel to the next, accruing meaning in juxtaposition and contrast, rather than development and completion. It is with these qualities in mind that Doc entreats its audience to experience this master.

  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 5 at 7:00 &bull; 72m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Record of a Tenement Gentleman</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1947</span> &bull; When a young boy is apparently abandoned by his father, a tenement owner brings him home, and convinces one of his renters, an embittered old woman, to take the child temporarily. While at first resistant to the boy, and eager to rid herself of him, she contradicts what seems to be her character and quickly forms such a close relationship with him that she comes to consider him her own. Even while asserting the possibility for the renewal of human kindness, <em>Record of a Tenement Gentleman</em> presents a stark picture of the desolation and breakdown of traditional familial bonds in postwar Japan. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 12 at 7:00 &bull; 108m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Late Spring</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1949</span> &bull; Setsuko Hara, with her inimitable charm and warmth, stars as Noriko, a young woman in her late twenties who is pressured by everyone in her life to settle down and get married. Noriko, however, has no interest in doing so. She prefers instead to stay single and care for her widowed father (Chishu Ryu). One of Ozu's most powerful family dramas, <em>Late Spring</em> explores poignantly and carefully conflicting notions of self-sacrifice, obligation, and personal desire in the shifting postwar social landscape, along with the sorrows and tensions that naturally arise from such notions. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="title"><p>Early Summer</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1951</span> &bull; Setsuko Hara stars again as a young woman named Noriko who is pressured by her family to marry, but <em>Early Summer</em> is more than a revision of <em>Late Spring</em>. This Noriko is a feistier incarnation, willing to go along with her family's wishes, but only on her own terms. Rather than accepting the matches presented to her, she makes her own decision. Early Summer engages all Ozu's classic postwar themes, particularly exploring the phenomenon of attitudinal change across generations, with the fast-paced transformation of Japan's 1950s economic boom serving as backdrop. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <a name="Early_Spring"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 26 at 7:00 &bull; 144m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Early Spring</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1956</span> &bull; Early Spring explores a familiar drudgery of postwar Japan&mdash;the day-to-day experience of the average office worker. In his 1952 <em>Ikiru</em>, Akira Kurosawa offered an alternative vision of the same, but one more sentimental and moralizing than what Ozu created here. The plot centers around an illicit love affair between two workers in a typically anonymous office, but story isn't all that important. Rather, the film becomes meaningful and relevant by its effective evocation of a tedious mode of being. A shining example of Ozu's subtlety, <em>Early Spring</em> is an interesting departure from his widely viewed family dramas. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 3 at 7:00 &bull; 140m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Tokyo Twilight</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1957</span> &bull; A critique of modernity's transformative effect on Japan that moves past melancholy toward vicious condemnation, <em>Tokyo Twilight</em> stands as a uniquely dark entry in Ozu's filmography, as Setsuko Hara finally assumes a role that is not completely lovable. With Hara's abandonment of her marriage, her younger sister running wild, and the return of a long-thought-dead mother, the film seems at first glance totally dominated by the modern crisis of the family's breakdown as a social institution, but the tense and necessary dichotomy found in Ozu's work between old and new values remains the film's backbone. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="Equinox_Flower"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 10 at 7:00 &bull; 118m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Equinox Flower</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1958</span> &bull; Light fare relative to other work in this program, <em>Equinox Flower</em> tells of a middle-aged businessman whose advice is sought by family friends and co-workers in the arrangement of romantic affairs. Though thought reliable for his considered, consistent advice, matters turn complicated, and hilarious, when he has trouble applying similarly flexible standards to his own daughter, a young woman eager to express herself and determine her own destiny. <em>Equinox Flower</em> still hits a refreshing note, displaying Ozu's diverse and playful application of his talents in his first color film. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="Floating_Weeds"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 17 at 7:00 &bull; 119m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Floating Weeds</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1959</span> &bull; <em>Floating Weeds</em> is a remake of Ozu's earlier, silent work, <em>The Story of Floating Weeds</em> (1934). A traveling Kabuki troupe provides the context for the director to explore the same complicated family dynamics he looked to so frequently. Though these theater folk are more boisterous and unreserved than the characters who populate Ozu's more typical family dramas, and its content somewhat racier and more lascivious (bribery-induced seductions, secret second mistresses, etc.), <em>Floating Weeds</em> returns us to that deep and beautiful sea of melancholy, transience, and loss that defines Ozu's greatest masterpieces.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="Late_Autumn"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 24 at 7:00 &bull; 128m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Late Autumn</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1960</span> &bull; Setsuko Hara graces the screen with her presence yet again, finally mature enough in years to play a widow rather than an unmarried daughter or devoted daughter-in-law. Sweetly comedic, <em>Late Autumn</em> is another beautiful meditation on changing human relationships and the tumults that rock small lives, even as tranquility and a passive acceptance of these define the film's aesthetic. As his career progresses into its final stage, the director's favorite themes have not grown tired. Rather, their staying power and boundless capacity to move audiences reaffirm the depth and complexity of Ozu's artistic project. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="An_Autumn_Afternoon"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 31 at 7:00 &bull; 112m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>An Autumn Afternoon</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Yasujiro Ozu, 1962</span> &bull; Chishu Ryu returns for Ozu's final film, once again playing a widower who must sacrifice his own well-being for that of a loved one. The sense of loss evoked by this swan song's goodbyes runs particularly deep, as we experience not only the dissolution of a standard of relationships, or a particular cultural moment, but of Yasujiro Ozu himself, and his camera's meditative gaze. One is left yearning, not just for a bygone era and lost sense of constancy, but over whether we will again be able to accept loss as this artist's unique cinematic language has enabled us to do. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
