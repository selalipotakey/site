<h1> Spring 2009,  Wednesday &bull; Cary Grant</h1>

<p class="seriesdesc">Before Tony Leung, there was Cary Grant.</p><a href="#movies">Skip to the movie listings</a>

<div class="series-essay">

<p>Cary Grant, or Archibald Alec Leach, was one of the studio era's most politic stars. When faced with the prospect of having to change his name to match the persona for which he was being groomed, a practice common at the time, Grant nonchalantly chose the letters CG, because so far they had been successful for both Gary Cooper and Clark Gable. A private Englishman who felt a celebrity should not share his political views, nor the intimate details of his life, Grant was an actor whose personal dignity bespoke a decidedly relaxed attitude toward fame. Today, his conservative aplomb stands as a silent rebuke to contemporary Hollywood's more public neurotics whose performances always seem to be spilling into daily life. On the other hand, at this very moment, across the ocean there is a vibrant community of Chinese thespians who are fulfilling the old paradigm. In interviews, these international stars, specifically the eminent Tony Leung, evidence a casual reserve and sly elusiveness, balanced by their steely professionalism as performers. Audience members may remember Mr. Leung as the charismatic lead of Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love for which he was awarded the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000. Mr. Leung's English is superb, but admirably he awaits the right script before he will venture to our shores. Perhaps he also awaits the right atmosphere, when his kind of celebrity is back in style. For now, Doc is proud to present the original Tony Leung in some of his classiest acts.</p>

<p>In the Mood for Love works a particularly close parallel to the film which will cap this series, An Affair to Remember.</p>

<p>Bringing Up Baby (Howard Hawks, 1938) &bull; The screwball comedy reached delirium, and the limits of its logic, in this Howard Hawks masterpiece about a paleontologist who is subjected to a chain of hilarious identity crises by a freewheeling society gal. As surely as Grant embodies Hawks's configuration of the eternal male, a feckless geek seeking Nature's order, Katharine Hepburn is the eternal female, an impulsive feline capriciously performing Nature's will. While this deeply idiosyncratic film failed to resonate with audiences at the time, perhaps due to its near hermetic pessimism, today it is widely held as the quintessence of its genre.</p>

<p>The Awful Truth (Leo McCarey, 1937) &bull; A landmark in Grant's career, this comedy of manners, thought to have been heavily improvised by Leo McCarey, is the film credited with creating the star's persona &ndash; bemused, elegant, and suave, but above all light as air. Grant and Irene Dunne play Jerry and Lucy Warriner, a high society couple who divorce under a cloud of mutual suspicion, only to discover they still love each other. What could easily have occasioned sentimental moralizing is redeemed in McCarey's earnest commitment to illuminating a couple's attempt to regain the simplicity of romantic love within a sophisticated and resolutely modern society.</p>

<p>Holiday (George Cukor, 1938) &bull; This comedy <font color="#000000">about an overconfident social climber (Grant) who becomes engaged to old money, only to fall head over heals for its socialite sibling (Katharine Hepburn), is imbued with a deliberately deceptive sheen of aplomb under George Cukor's elegant, tonally balanced direction, all the better to articulate the protagonist's hypnotic sense of self-denial, verging on split personality. Like many of Cukor's leads, Grant faces the duality of his own way of life, and is forced to choose between the smothering stability of wealth and tradition, and the dizzying promiscuity of a nonconformist, high roller existence. </p>

<p>Only Angels Have Wings (Howard Hawks, 1939) &bull; As a laid-back entrepreneur, the sole owner and proprietor of a backwater airmail station in Columbia, Geoff Carter (Grant) cultivates a male idyll, his own private kingdom where he enjoys the breezy camaraderie and companionship of his fellow pilots. But when Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur), an itinerant nightclub singer, invades this bar room scene, Carter's painstakingly preserved sense of fatalism faces dissolution, as he begins to understand love. Acclaimed at the time for its muscularly staged flight sequences, in these moments of unadorned poetry Only Angels Have Wings may represent the purest expression of the Hawksian worldview.</p>

<p>His Girl Friday (Howard Hawks, 1940) &bull; In this comedy of remarriage, Grant plays the editor of a metropolitan daily who convinces his ex-wife and star reporter (Rosalind Russell), to forgo her impending remarriage and retirement to motherhood, in order to cover one last story, all in an effort to prevent her from remarrying altogether. As with Bringing Up Baby, the dialogue crackles with wit and intelligence, but the real revelation is in Hawks'a use of overlapping sound to create the impression of people talking over each other simultaneously instead of in turn, a stylistic innovation well suited to the argumentative nature of the characters.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Story (George Cukor, 1940) &bull; The second collaboration between Cukor, Grant, and Hepburn following Holiday, this work inverts the plot of that film with Hepburn assuming the lead as a spoiled rich girl engaged to a nouveau riche, then adds a twist by giving her the pick of two idiosyncratic, fully realized men in addition to her fianc&eacute;e. As the ex-husband competing with a tabloid reporter (Jimmy Stewart) and the husband-to-be (John Howard), Grant is alternately irritated and enthralled by Hepburn, balancing his conflicted feelings with the same sense of composure that made him such a good fit for Cukor's nuanced direction.</p>

<p>Notorious &bull; Grant plays a deeply suspicious government agent who finds himself falling in love with the vulnerable daughter of a convicted Nazi (Ingrid Bergman), while at the same time trying to convince her to seduce one of her father's old associates in an effort to infiltrate a German spy ring in Brazil. Amidst a complex plot, Hitchcock never loses sight of his characters, employing his signature reversals of perspective to reveal the inherent complexities of human relationships. Keep an eye out for one of the most famous kisses in cinema, and, of course, a cameo by the director himself.</p>

<p>I Was a Male War Bride (Howard Hawks, 1949) &bull; As implied by its title, this World War II comedy enacts a dementedly self-conscious play on male humiliation. Assuming the role of a Free French popinjay who marries an all American servicewoman (Ann Sheridan), Grant must earn the military's official ``war bride'' status to attain an emigration visa to the States. After a string of derisive mishaps and misidentifications, all typically screwball but endowed here with the same sense of discomfort and disillusionment that would define much post-war auteur cinema, the picture famously culminates with Grant donning an asinine blond wig to fool Navy bureaucracy. </p>

<p>Charade (Stanley Donen, 1963) &bull; In this delightful, last hurrah, Grant plays the least untrustworthy of a group of eccentric male stalkers pursuing Audrey Hepburn, all of whom claim to have been associates of her recently-deceased husband, and convinced she has the gold he swindled out of them during the War. Shot in Technicolor on location in Paris, which Donen exploits beautifully, this farcical suspense thriller is Hitchcock-lite in the best sense, elegantly photographed, cleverly plotted, and exuding an atmosphere of impish mischief telegraphed in its stars' tongue-in-cheek repartee and Henry Mancini's playful score.</p>

<p>An Affair to Remember (Leo McCarey, 1957) &bull; Doc closes its Cary Grant retrospective on a contrastingly delicate note of resignation and pathos with Leo McCarey's sumptuous color and cinemascope retake of his own 1939 Love Affair. On a cruise liner bound for New York, a playboy (Grant) and a nightclub singer (Deborah Kerr), both unhappily committed elsewhere, enjoy a fleeting tryst, after which they promise to meet at an obscure point in their futures. In this twilight masterpiece, both its star and its director sensibly refused to recycle old tricks, choosing instead to meet age, and their encroaching obsolescence, with sober reflection.
