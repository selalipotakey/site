    <strong>So Dark the Night</strong><br />
    <em>Joseph H. Lewis</em>, 1946 &bull; Described by one admirer as a &lsquo;Simenonized <em>La r&egrave;gle du jeu</em>,&rsquo; <em>So Dark the Night</em> is the first major film by Joseph H. &ldquo;<em>Gun Crazy</em>&rdquo; Lewis, the great B-picture  stylist who, like James Whale, infused his films with a pictorial virtuosity  their scripts hardly demanded. Here Lewis brings schizophrenic terror to the  French countryside, where famed detective Henri Cassin has ventured to seek  curative repose. Instead he finds jealousy, class antagonism, scandal, and  strangulation! Meanwhile Lewis finds threadbare excuses to formulate a wholly  singular development in the film noir&mdash;the pastoral baroque. 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>

      <strong>Slattery&rsquo;s Hurricane</strong><br />
    <em>Andre de Toth, 1949 &bull; </em>In this late forties potboiler, Richard Widmark plays Will  Slattery, a military pilot turned private flier, who runs into an old war buddy, discovering he has married his ex-lover  Aggie (Linda Darnell). Recklessly determining to pursue her in abandon of both  his former compatriot and his own drug-addicted girlfriend Dolores (Veronica  Lake), Slattery sets a web of deceit and betrayal that eventually consumes all  four characters, a mode of thematic and stylistic progression that bears  particular resonance in the emotionally stark cinema of Andre de Toth<em>. </em>35mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>
  <p>Friday, June 27 &bull; 7:00 &amp; 9:30 PM &bull; 110m <a name="MasteroftheHouse" id="MasteroftheHouse"></a><img src="../06_media/2008-03_images/01Week/dreyer_master_of_the_houseTN.jpg" width="130" height="100" class="image" /><br />
      <strong>The Master of the House</strong><br />
    <em>Carl Dreyer, 1925 &bull;</em> A failed and self-indulgent businessman&rsquo;s tyrannical nature  towards his dutiful wife causes their nurse to devise the wife&rsquo;s abandonment  from the household, in order to teach her master what it means to face life  alone. This wonderful silent comedy from Carl Dreyer eloquently displays the  master&rsquo;s early command of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne,  and, for those used to the somber tone of his later masterpieces, offers a  startlingly light-hearted treatment of his core theme: the liberation of an idealistic woman from the abuses of patriarchal  hypocrisy. The film's commercial success led Dreyer to France, where he was  commissioned to make his first large budget film, the widely regarded The Passion of Joan of Arc. 16mm.

      <strong>Dillinger is Dead</strong><br />
    <em>Marco Ferreri, 1969</em> &bull; Ferreri&rsquo;s surreal  portrayal of a bored man&rsquo;s night at home received extreme criticism and praise  upon its initial release. While many found its violence excessive, the Cahiers  du Cin&eacute;ma subsequently published an interview with Ferreri and helped launch  the next phase of his career in Paris. The plot of the surreal film centers on  Glauco (Michel Piccoli), an industrial designer who comes home from work to  find an ill wife and a cold plate of food. He spends the evening trying to  entertain himself: he prepares a gourmet meal, paints polka dots on an old  revolver, seduces the maid, and repeatedly enacts suicide. Despite the film&rsquo;s  reputation as a masterpiece, it fell into oblivion in the 1980&rsquo;s, and has been  screened only a handful of times since. Italian with English subtitles. 35mm.

    <strong></strong>
  <strong>Lost, Lost, Lost<br />
  <br />
  </strong><em>Jonas Mekas, 1975</em> &bull; Since arriving in Brooklyn in 1949, displaced  Lithuanian poet Jonas Mekas had recorded fragments of his life with a Bolex  camera as practice for a future feature. <em>Lost,  Lost, Lost</em> collects the footage from 1949 to 1963 to weave together a  diary-document of Mekas&rsquo;s life: his anxieties as an immigrant, his contact with  New York poets, his gradual salvation in cinema. &ldquo;The period I am dealing with  in these six reels was a period of desperation, of attempts to desperately grow  roots into the new ground, to create new memories &hellip; I tried to indicate how it  feels to be in exile, how I felt in those years.&rdquo; 16mm.

    <strong>The Bowery</strong><br />
    <em>Raoul Walsh, 1933</em> &bull; Denounced by the left upon its release for  spotlighting ballyhoo over poverty, <em>The  Bowery</em> might be Walsh&rsquo;s masterpiece. A tall tale of feuding beer barons  (George Raft and Wallace Beery) the film embellishes Walsh&rsquo;s ownmemories of growing up in Gay Nineties  New York, freely mingling historical incidents (Carrie Nation&rsquo;s saloon raids,  the Spanish-American war) with sneering vulgarity and, per Bill Everson, &ldquo;casual sadism, as witness  the fire in the Chinese laundry, with tragedy played as pure slapstick.&rdquo; Co-starring Fay Wray as a whore who bites Raft&rsquo;s  hand and Jackie Cooper as pint-sized terror &ldquo;Swipes&rdquo; McGurk. 35mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>
  <p>Saturday, July 5 &bull; 7:00 &bull; 170m<a name="TheThinRedLine" id="TheThinRedLine"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-03_images/02Week/malick_thin_red_lineTN.jpg" width="222" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    <strong>The Thin Red Line<br />
    <br />
    </strong><em>Terrence Malick, 1998</em> &bull; In  this epic production, Terrence Malick brings together an ensemble of top actors  to depict James Jones&rsquo; memoir of warfare in the South Pacific. The tale is no  conventional war film; in the minds of critics and fans, <em>The Thin Red Line</em> brings substance to what may have been the  turning point of WWII. As a call to remembrance of Guadalcanal (a battle  earlier and in some ways larger in scale than Normandy) Malick&rsquo;s film far  outweighs the vapid flag-waving and violent spectacle of similar war films.  Characters don&rsquo;t pontificate or emote&mdash;they live in a world doused by  historicity and conflict, and Malick, as put by Jonathan Rosenbaum, &ldquo;mutes the  drama periodically and turns it into reverie&hellip; about the meaning and  consequences of war.&rdquo; This should be an Independence Day classic, since through  the course of the film, neither victory nor defeat are taken lightly. 35mm.</p>
  
  
  <p>Wednesday, July 9 &bull; 8:00 PM &bull; 90m<a name="Presents" id="Presents"></a><br />
    <strong>Presents<br />
    </strong><em>Michael Snow, 1980-81</em> &bull; This playful formalist experiment opens with a simulated &lsquo;scratch&rsquo; in  the celluloid, and seems to test the resistance of various medial boundaries  between film and video, reality and artifice, and finally the world and  perception itself. This operation takes a variety of different forms in  progression. The film begins with a classical study of a female figure,  proceeds as a light comedy, complete with sets moved atop forklifts. When the  camera suddenly turns psychotic and bulldozes the entire set, the final  movement resolves in a rapid, ecstatic montage. 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>

    <strong>Sophie&rsquo;s Place<br />
    <br />
    </strong><em>Larry Jordan, 1986</em> &bull; Consummation  of five year&rsquo;s work, <em>Sophie&rsquo;s Place</em> is a collage animation conceived as &ldquo;alchemical autobiography&rdquo;, a contemplative  exploration of the artist&rsquo;s imaginary world in search of the elusive Sophia,  Greek goddess of wisdom. Amid a trove of symbolic representations of exotic and  classical places and things, most paradoxically the converted cathedral-mosque  Hagia Sophia, Sophie presents herself in myriad forms, and yet always in a process  of transformation. In this serene dreamwork, she guides us through a  philosophical journey not to be missed. 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>
  
  
  <p>Friday, July 11 &bull; 7:00 &amp; 9:30pm &bull; 120m<a name="MilleniumMambo" id="MilleniumMambo"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-03_images/03Week/hou_millennium_mamboTN.jpg" width="178" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    <strong>Millennium Mambo<br />
    <br />
  </strong><em>Hou Hsiao-hsien, 2001</em> &bull; Narrating  ten years from the future, a woman named Vicky (Taiwanese star Shu Qi) tells us  a story of her youth as a hostess in Taipei: It is the year 2001. The world is  greeting the 21st Century and celebrating the new millennium. Caught  in an inescapable relationship with a drug-addicted trance artist, Vicky floats  through the clubs and bars of Taipei searching for a way out. This first effort  in Hou&rsquo;s current, &ldquo;global&rdquo; period has disenchanted even many of his most ardent  champions with its seemingly superficial depiction of Taipei&rsquo;s contemporary  youth culture and radical redefinition of the master&rsquo;s style. But the closer  the first decade of the new millennium comes to its end the more visionary this  film seems. Its hypnotic opening shot, perhaps one of the greatest in the  history of cinema, transports us into a past that is also the present. By this  gesture, Hou seems to say, we need the cinema now more than ever. 35mm.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <p>Saturday, July 12 &bull; 7:00 &amp; 9:30pm &bull; 103m<a name="Scanners" id="Scanners"></a><br />
      <strong>Scanners</strong><br />
      <em>David Cronenberg, 1981</em> &bull; One  of Cronenberg&rsquo;s most famous and accomplished works from his most fruitful  period, Scanners depicts a near-future society in which Earth&rsquo;s population is  at war with the Scanners, an aberrant form of superhuman possessing fantastic  telekinetic powers.&nbsp; When one young man  is found to be in possession of these powers, he is taken under the wing of a  doctor hoping to use him to ferret out the leader of the Scanners&rsquo; world  domination movement.&nbsp; Cleverly combining  his usual body horrors with trenchant political and social satire, Cronenberg  delivers a memorable and unique sci-fi flick. 16mm.</p>
  <p>Wednesday, July 16 &bull; 8:00 PM &bull; 60m<a name="ARomanceOfHappyValley" id="ARomanceOfHappyValley"></a><br />
      <strong>A Romance of Happy Valley</strong><br />
      <em>D.W. Griffith, 1919</em> &bull; The  late teens were a period of re-entrenchment for Griffith. He followed his  bombastic World War I epic <em>Hearts of the  World</em> with a series of &lsquo;short story&rsquo; pictures that would emphasize &lsquo;the sun  on the corn and the wind.&rsquo; This charming entry is the most nostalgic of the  lot, harking back to Griffith&rsquo;s boyhood days in rural Kentucky. Lillian Gish  stars as the faithful sweetheart of a brash young Bobby Harron, the son of a farmer  who ventures north to make it big in New York City by designing a swimming toy  frog! Many silent films are carelessly described as corny, but here is one film  that deserves, seeks, and proudly wears that title. 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>
  <p>Thursday, July 17 &bull; 8:00 PM &bull; 90m<a name="TheSorrowsOfSatan" id="TheSorrowsOfSatan"></a><br />
      <strong>The Sorrows of Satan</strong><br />
      <em>D.W. Griffith, 1926</em> &bull; &ldquo;In  freedom from all worry and with the resources of the world&rsquo;s foremost film  organization at his disposal, D. W. Griffith is now in the golden age of his  art,&rdquo; declared Paramount in the publicity run-up to Griffith&rsquo;s first studio  production. In truth, Griffith has been handed the reins of a disastrous  production abandoned by no less than Cecil B. DeMille. A kind of flapper  rendition of <em>Faust</em> with ridiculous,  sublime pictorial effects, staggering sets, and a great vampish turn by Lya de  Putti, <em>The Sorrows of Satan </em>was, like  many Griffith efforts, a work that could perhaps only be appreciated in  hindsight, through its affinities with Sternberg and Murnau. 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>
  <p>Friday, July 18 &bull; 7:00 &amp; 9:30 PM &bull; 120m<a name="IsntLifeWonderful" id="IsntLifeWonderful"></a><img src="../06_media/2008-03_images/04Week/griffith_isn't_life_wonderful_1TN.jpg" width="131" height="100" class="image" /><br />
      <strong>Isn&rsquo;t Life Wonderful?</strong><br />
      <em>D.W. Griffith, 1924</em> &bull;Griffith&rsquo;s last gasp of independence before a ruinous  contract with Paramount came in the form of this, a harsh film shot largely on  location in K&ouml;penick, Germany. Characteristically Griffith chose his location  not for its political implications but because the conditions there best  demonstrated &ldquo;the triumph of love over hardship&rdquo; A slow, devastating film  that documents the plight of Polish immigrants (played by Neil Hamilton and  Griffith&rsquo;s much-maligned mistress-sweetheart Carol Dempster) in the  inflation-ridden Weimar Republic, <em>Isn&rsquo;t  Life Wonderful? </em>immediately influenced Pabst and anticipated Italian  neo-realism by twenty years. 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>
  <p>Saturday, July 19 &bull; 7:00 PM - (<b>NOTE SCHEDULE CHANGE</b>) &bull; 87m<strong></strong><a name="TheStruggle" id="TheStruggle"></a><img src="../06_media/2008-03_images/04Week/griffith_the_struggle_2TN.jpg" width="128" height="100" class="image" /><br />
      <strong>The Struggle</strong><br />
      <em>D.W. Griffith, 1931</em> &bull; By  1931 Griffith was dismissed by the industry he had created. Critics denounced  his final effort as Soviet propaganda on the basis of its title&mdash;a rather  incredible rumor given that this anti-alcohol polemic is the last, wheezy  flowering of a certain strain of Victorian moralizing hardly updated since  Griffith&rsquo;s 1909 Biograph one-reelers. Shot on location in the Bronx with a  sophisticated sound design, <em>The Struggle</em> was nevertheless panned or ignored by the trade papers and withdrawn from  circulation after a week. Difficult today for its ethnic stereotypes, <em>The Struggle </em>is nevertheless, per Andrew  Sarris, &lsquo;clearly the work of a giant even when that giant is thrashing about  inarticulately.&rsquo; Archival 35mm.</p>

      <em>Joyce Wieland, 1969</em> &bull;One of the most important  experimental filmmakers of the 1960s and 70s, Joyce Wieland worked in a variety  of different styles and media, including painting and quilt-making. &ldquo;La Raison  Avant la Passion&rdquo;, her first feature film, is an essayistic journey across  Canada that attempts to reconcile the vast North American landscape with 537  computer-generated permutations of the title quote by Canadian Prime Minister  Pierre Trudeau, at once occasioning a meditation on the tense political  atmosphere of the late 1960s. For Hollis Frampton, this collision of expanse  and ideology seemed &ldquo;lucidly caught, bound as it were chemically, in the  substance of film itself&hellip;&rdquo; 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>

      <em>Valentin de Las Sierras </em><em>&bull; 1968 &bull; 10m<br />
    </em>The  films of Bruce Baillie form an elaborate mesh of images of intense clarity and  images of vague abstraction, while equally complex sound schemes create a kind  of primal grounding for the viewer. In his search for reconciliation between  the world of concrete things and the world of illusion, Baillie employs a  panoply of filmic techniques, most notably superimposition, but these effects  never seem mechanistic, rather always eerily natural. Hence, his films embody  the equilibrium for which they strive. The work presented here gives a sense of  Baillie&rsquo;s development from a young to a mature artist. 16mm.

    <strong>Pierrot le fou<br />
    </strong><em>Jean-Luc Godard, 1965</em> &bull; Godard once famously claimed that all one needed  to make a film was a girl and a gun. <em>Gun  Crazy</em> notwithstanding, Godard disproved his own thesis with this  extravagant folly: a simple story of a girl and a gun&mdash;or, if you prefer, &lsquo;the  last romantic couple&rsquo;&mdash;all dolled up with restless allusions to Vietnam, Samuel  Fuller, Auguste Renoir, and the unceasing dullness of bourgeois life. Godard&rsquo;s  longest and most successful narrative feature, <em>Pierrot le fou</em> finds the filmmaker in a perfect balance between  homage, film historical tract, political commentary, and all-pistons-smoking  entertainment.

    <strong>Camp<br />
    </strong><em>Andy Warhol, 1965</em> &bull; A still-timely rejoinder to Susan Sontag's seminal essay 1964 'Notes on Camp,' Camp is a beguiling slice-of-life from the Factory, where campier-than-thou personalities (including Jack Smith and Mario Montez) recount adolescent summer camp experiences, perform routines, and cavort with abandon in one of Warhol's earliest, least somnambulistic 'talkies.' Warhol's film returns Sontag's wobbly concept to its source: not the momentary gawking provoked by the detritus of pop culture but the authentic expression of those for whom life is one extended countercultural performance. 16mm.

      <strong>Tragedy of the Street</strong> (Dirnentrag&ouml;die) <br />
      <em>Bruno Rahn</em><em>, 1927</em> &bull; Tragedy of the Street, a  rarely screened gem, tells the melodramatic story of an aging prostitute&rsquo;s  desperate struggle for the affection of her young lover and her tragic  downfall. One of the most significant sociocritical pictures of its time, the  film is particularly noteworthy for Asta Nielsen&rsquo;s bravura performance as the  withered streetwalker. Contemporary film critic Willie Haas wrote about the  film: &ldquo;Film art in its entirety can offer no greater artistic pleasure than a  mimic monologue by Asta Nielsen. 16mm.

    <strong>Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans<br />
  </strong><em>F.W. Murnau, 1927</em> &bull; The culmination of a fashionable transnational  film style and probably of the medium itself, <em>Sunrise</em> remains a mass of dazzling contradictions and dichotomies:  a universal fable rendered in modernist style that contrasts the values of a  Man (George O&rsquo;Brien) and His Wife (Janet Gaynor) with those of the Woman from  the City (Margaret Livingston), <em>Sunrise</em> was Hollywood&rsquo;s greatest bid to produce prestigious attractions with the best  foreign talent. Scripted and directed by a German but shot around Hollywood,  this story &lsquo;of every place and no place&rsquo; also bridged the gap between silence  and sound with its atmospheric music and effects track. 35mm.</p>

    </strong><em>F.W. Murnau, 1931</em> &bull; Reeling from Fox&rsquo;s butchery of his previous  film, Murnau embarked on an expedition to the South Seas with Robert Flaherty.  Murnau returned with this stunning independent production that Paramount  distributed, but he died in a car crash before its premiere. For years the  film&rsquo;s considerable beauty was attributed to Flaherty, but now <em>Tabu</em> is acknowledged as thoroughly a Murnau  achievement, his themes of doomed love and transcendence fully evident despite  the semi-documentary framework that informs the flight of Reri and Matahi. Only  Murnau could conjure this alluring &lsquo;paradise lost&rsquo;&mdash;-ethnography as the last  flowering of German Romanticism. 35mm.</p>

    </em>Sidney Peterson (1905-2000) was one of America&rsquo;s most important  avant-garde filmmakers. Peterson&rsquo;s aesthetic focuses in a way his lens  sometimes (deliberately) does not: he unflinchingly assesses his viewers&rsquo; and  his own perception of the world using experimental camera and editing  techniques. Yet none of narrative content of his films is lost on Peterson&rsquo;s  formulaic finesse. These four films represent some of Peterson&rsquo;s best work.  Presented in 16mm.

      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1965</em> &bull; When  six soldiers and one woman become trapped in an underground munitions dump, the  ensuing battle of wills against a cacophonous chamber of oblivion becomes the  stuff of Edgar Ulmer&rsquo;s swan song, if it can be called that exactly, announcing  itself as it does, not with nostalgic melancholia, but with the same bitter,  funereal finality that is found in the contemporary works of many an auteur in  this period from Anthony Mann&rsquo;s <em>Man of  the West</em> and Andre de Toth&rsquo;s <em>Day of  the Outlaw</em>, to Orson Welles&rsquo;s <em>The  Trial</em> and John Ford&rsquo;s <em>The Man Who  Shot Liberty Valance</em>.

    <strong>The Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice<br />
    </strong><em>Yasujiro Ozu, 1952</em> &bull; This melancholy domestic comedy was one of Ozu&rsquo;s most successful works for Shochiku. A wife finds herself unhappy in her arranged marriage to a mild-mannered executive. Meanwhile the wife&rsquo;s niece protests her own imminent arranged marriage, escaping with her uncle to a pachinko parlor where they meet (who else?) Chishu Ryu. A wistful affirmation of the overriding value of shopworn institutions and provincial tastes (such as titular dish) that inspired gentle scorn from Kurosawa, this film nevertheless finds Ozu experimenting with cinematic tricks that would be eliminated in Tokyo Story, his mature masterwork of the next year.

    <strong>Charulata (The Lonely Wife)<br />
    </strong>Satyajit Ray, 1965 &bull; After the international success of his Apu trilogy, Satyajit Ray moved  towards more politically-engaged and aesthetically-elaborate features. Of the  second group, <em>Charulata</em> is probably  the high point&mdash;a feature-length adaptation of a Rabindranath Tagore novel that  has a delicacy and economy of expression more often associated with the short  story. The film follows the titular heroine, the bored wife of a rapidly  westernized aristocrat, who gradually realizes the depth of her affection for  her cousin. The film's style&mdash;a nouvelle vague approach to the melodrama with a  hint of Robert Florey&mdash;is singular and unforgettable. Bengali  with English Subtitles. 35mm.</p>

      <em>Kenji Mizoguchi, 1947 </em>&bull; As great as any picture  Mizoguchi ever made, <em>Utamaro and His Five  Women </em>is an unconventional account of the eighteenth century wood-block  artist Kitagawa Utamaro. Neither a biopic nor a treatise on the artist&rsquo;s work  (which is not glimpsed until the final scene), the film concentrates instead on  the milieu that inspired Utamaro&rsquo;s work. This, Mizoguchi&rsquo;s first post-war film,  sketches a beguiling panorama of loosely related characters (models, students,  courtesans, patrons) who grow and recede in importance throughout the casual  narrative whose rhythms resemble the Ford of <em>Steamboat &lsquo;Round the Bend</em> more readily than the Mizoguchi of <em>Ugetsu</em>.

  </strong>Yvonne Rainer, 1976 <em> </em>&bull;From avant-gardist  extraordinaire Yvonne Rainer comes the story of a Hungarian female lion tamer  who arrives in New York to become a dance choreographer. Throughout her enquiry  into gender and masquerade Rainer experiments with various ways of addressing  the audience, segueing between fiction, documentary, autobiography, and  feminist theory. Rainer herself began as a choreographer noted for her emphasis  on everyday activities like walking, running, and sitting. But by the time she  made <em>Kristina Talking Pictures</em>, she  had perfected a kind of Brechtian filmmaking that smacks of political  radicalism, Godard, and May &rsquo;68&mdash;a genre some critics call &quot;Menippean  satire&rdquo;. 16mm.

      <em>Alfred Hitchcock, 1972 </em>&bull;Hitchcock hit an artistic  rut in his later years, but created a masterpiece with his penultimate film.  The plot concerns the rampage through London of a serial rapist/killer known as  the necktie murderer. In a return to the &ldquo;wrongfully accused&rdquo; theme of so many  Hitchcock films, the protagonist (Jon Finch) becomes a prime suspect when his  ex-wife is brutally slain. Frenzy contains several moments of cinematic  brilliance, as well as glimpses of violence matched only by the &ldquo;shower scene&rdquo;  from Psycho. The reliance on location shooting and public settings appears  abnormal for a Hitchcock film, suggesting that at age seventy-three the  director was prepared to comment on something like &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;. 35mm.</p>

    Roberto Rossellini, 1950 &bull; A hagiography staged in a series of vignettes drawn from the 14th  Century florilegium Floretti di San Francesco (Little Flowers of St. Francis),  this outstanding work from Roberto Rossellini&rsquo;s middle period, with its  photography designed to evoke medieval devotional painting and a cast of monks  from the Nocera Inferiore Monastery, proposes to take the viewer back to the  very moment in space-time when St. Francis was<em> present</em> in the world. The world here is a sensuous biosphere, and  this sensuality is inspirational and Godly. Italian with English Subtitles.  35mm.</p>

	<em>Douglas Sirk</em> &bull; Naomi Murdoch (Barbara Stanwyck) left Riverside, Wyoming in 1900, fleeing the stifling social expectations of her small-town life and leaving behind her husband and three children to become an actress. Ten years later, she returns. Her reappearance is fraught with scandal as town, husband, daughters, son, and lover all react to who she was when she left them - and confront who she is upon her return. Sirk's staging plays men and women against the spaces they inhabit, powerfully evoking the tensions and contradictions between imperfect human longings and social facades. 35mm.

      <em>Budd Boetticher, 1960</em> &bull;After a stint in jail,  jewelry thief Legs Diamond goes afterhis boss despite the misgivings of his  good-natured gal Alice. Better known for his Ranown Westerns, Boetticher&rsquo;s lone  gangster film portrays real dancer-turned-mobster Jack Diamond lightheartedly,  in conscious objection to the violent cinema audiences had been accustomed to.  Despite strong dislike for his protagonist, Boetticher adopted the style of the  silents made during the real Diamond&rsquo;s popular New York City reign. Simplistic  compositions and morally-concerned lighting did not tamper his flair for the  tragicomic, however, assuring directorial continuity in this underappreciated  study in genre definition. 16mm.

    </strong><em>Jean Renoir, 1935</em> &bull; Ignored by the French critical establishment  then much enthralled with the hackwork of Marcel Pagnol, Renoir&rsquo;s <em>Toni</em> can now be confidently cited&mdash;along  with other Doc discoveries such as <em>Isn&rsquo;t  Life Wonderful? </em>and <em>La mancha de  sangre&mdash;</em>as a fully-developed antecedent to the Italian neo-realism of the  1940s. Renoir began with a salacious newspaper story and took his crew  (including assistant Luchino Visconti) to the Martingues region where the  incidents had unfolded. The film, which centers on the bed-hopping, social-climbing  habits of Italian immigrant Antonio Canova (Charles Blavette), is filled with  authentic details of working class provincial life.

      <em>Fritz Lang, 1952</em> &bull; A Wyoming rancher seeks revenge on the man who savagely  raped and murdered his fianc&eacute;e. His suspenseful quest to  unearth and trap the unknown killer is thrown off course when he meets alluring  saloon queen Altar (Marlene Dietrich) at an infamous outlaw-hideaway named  Chuck-a-Luck and begins to fall in love with her.

But the couple's happiness is threatened by Arthur's  ex, who is determined to tear them apart. Thanks to Arthur and Boyer's  marvelous chemistry, this underappreciated gem is a highly unusual mix of  comedy, romance, and intense melodrama. The film gains depth with Borzage's  trademark romanticism, especially during the thrilling, Titanic-like shipboard  climax. The elegant photography is by the great cinematographer Gregg Toland  (Citizen Kane). 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>

    <strong>Broken Lullaby (a.k.a The Man I Killed)</strong><br />
    <em>Ernst Lubitsch, 1932</em> &bull; &ldquo;Departing from his usual métier of romantic comedies, Lubitsch made this rare foray into drama in the middle of what is effectively the invention of the American film musical, and in a way it is a reverse companion piece to the frothy greatness of his Chevalier films.  Like The Student Prince of Old Heidelberg and Bluebeard's Eighth Wife, this film embraces the romantic couple as a hinge about which the anxieties of a society can be explored as here a French soldier begins an erotic relationship with the fiancée of a German soldier he killed.  New York Times critic Mordaunt Hall claimed it was better than The Last Laugh. 16mm. This film does not exist on DVD.</p>

      <strong>Night of the Living Dead</strong><br />
      <em>George Romero, 1968</em> &bull;George Romero&rsquo;s 1968 horror masterpiece depicts a world gone awry when  the dead start coming back to life and devouring the living.&nbsp; When a pair of young siblings is assaulted by  a cadaver in a cemetery, the sister flees to a nearby farmhouse and takes  refuge with a rag-tag band of socially-disparate individuals.&nbsp; Basically a single-handed founding of the  Zombie Film as it is now known, as well as a trenchant and multi-faceted social  satire, Romero&rsquo;s film has, in the 40s years since its release, proved itself  more than worthy of its canonical stature. 35mm.</p>
