	<div class="title"><p>Slumdog Millionaire</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Danny Boyle, 2008</span> &bull; Through cleverly bridged flashbacks, Slumdog Millionaire explores the Dickensian tale of Jamal Malik, the young underdog on the hot seat of India's Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. The film encourages us to identify with the charismatic hero and his many sidekicks, and to enjoy its smorgasbord of romance, suspense, comedy and drama. But beneath the Bollywood glamour and A.R. Rahman's lively score is an unflinching look at Mumbai's present-day street life, and Boyle does not let us ignore this stark reality. Recipient of 8 Oscars, including Best Picture. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="showings-length"><p>April 4 at 7:00, 9:15 &bull; April 5 at 3:30 &bull; 106m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Quantum of Solace</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Marc Forster, 2008</span> &bull; In keeping with Casino Royale's aim to remodel the franchise, this latest Bond actually follows its antecedent as a direct sequel. Pursuing those responsible for his lover's death, 007 uncovers Quantum, an information age S.P.E.C.T.R.E., whose lead agent poses as an environmentalist! The film strikes a dour tone telegraphed by Daniel Craig's chiseled features and novel disinterest in his heroine. Gone is Pierce Brosnan's self-reflexive humor, which blithely acknowledged the character as a cultural anachronism. This Bond is contemporary, righteous and deathly serious. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<a name="Milk"></a>
	<div class="showings-length"><p>April 10 at 6:30, 9:00, 11:30 &bull; April 12 at 1:00 &bull; 128m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Milk</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Gus Van Sant, 2008</span> &bull; As the nation's first openly gay elected official, Harvey Milk, like Rosa Parks, was the right person at the right time. Milk's success at spearheading the defeat of Proposition 6 is a historical rebuke to us, 30 years on with the passing of last year's Proposition "H8". Commencing at Milk's assassination, Van Sant's biopic proceeds in a non-linear narrative progression, anchored by a recording Milk made a few months before his death. The direction brilliantly evokes the seventies through its seamless incorporation of historical footage throughout the film. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="showings-length"><p>April 11 at 6:30, 9:15 &bull; April 12 at 3:30 &bull; 141m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Changeling</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Clint Eastwood, 2008</span> &bull; Clint Eastwood's sprawling and complex period piece, based on the true case of a kidnapped Los Angeles boy, intricately and brilliantly weaves a murder mystery, an account of police corruption and brutality, and a fierce indictment of mental health institutions into an extremely fast paced two and a half hours. Distinguished by an outstanding Oscar nominated performance by Angelina Jolie and a fierce supporting cast, which includes Jeffrey Donovan in a career performance, Eastwood proves he is still one of the most important filmmakers in Hollywood today. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="title"><p>Let the Right One In</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Tomas Alfredson, 2008</span> &bull; This Swedish vampire film is an intelligent movie whose sweetness lingers long after the curtains close. One can't help but coo over undead Eli and Oskar, her prematurely downtrodden boy companion, as they deal with the tricky business of feeding a pre-teen vampire in a small, reserved town. Squeamish viewers may begrudge the authentic display of gore, but this is foremost a story about learning to trust others during our fragile prepubescent years. Don't judge Oskar's complicity too harshly. What wouldn't you have done for your middle school crush? <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="showings-length"><p>April 18 at 7:00, 9:30 &bull; April 19 at 1:00 &bull; 124m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>The Reader</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Stephen Daldry, 2008</span> &bull; This adaptation of a 1995 novel by Bernhard Schlink constructs its story in flashback. A young boy and an older woman (Kate Winslet) engage in a passionate affair in post-War Germany. Decades later, the boy, now a lawyer (Ralph Fiennes), discovers his former lover was a concentration camp guard and is on trial for war crimes. Now, the young man must reconcile his lingering feelings with the horrible knowledge of his inamorata's past. Under Stephen Daldry's artful direction, the interweaving of an erotic affair with the Holocaust's brutalities appears natural and seamless. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<a name="Doubt"></a>
	<div class="showings-length"><p>April 24 at 6:45, 9:00, 11:15 &bull; April 26 at 1:00 &bull; 104m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Doubt</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">John Patrick Shanley, 2008</span> &bull; In a powerful ensemble performance, Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis (all Oscar-nominated) give poignancy and complexity to a story beyond that provided by its script. Less skilled hands could easily have rendered this drama about a priest who allegedly molests an African-American student, and the top nun who pursues him, into a facile, political sermon. Instead the hot-button issue serves as a catalyst for meditation on the broader metaphysical issues at work, and the fine line between political and personal morality. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="showings-length"><p>April 25 at 7:00, 10:15 &bull; April 26 at 3:15 &bull; 166m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">David Fincher, 2008</span> &bull; This Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) picture sounds like pure Hollywood sentiment, but considered viewing reveals a reinvigoration of American magic realism, worthy of Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter. Born an arthritic baby, Benjamin Button is destined to age backwards. Rather than milk this gimmick for dramatic effects, David Fincher wisely attends the subtle ways this condition defamiliarizes commonplace human experiences, making them wondrous and all the more apparently mortal. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

<div class="movie">
	<a name="Frost/Nixon"></a>
	<div class="showings-length"><p>May 1 at 6:30, 9:00, 11:30 &bull; May 3 at 1:00 &bull; 122m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Frost/Nixon</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Ron Howard, 2008</span> &bull; It is somehow fittingly perverse that this prestige picture analogizes David Frost's Nixon Interviews to a battle of wits between Frank Langella, one of the great Draculas, and Michael Sheen, werewolf Lucian in the Underworld franchise. Hoping to salvage his reputation in the wake of public embarrassment, the satirist Frost confronts Nixon about his Watergate wrongdoings, as Nixon contrives to recoup his image for history's sake. Ron Howard deftly sets the conflict between the two men against the backdrop of America's exploding media culture. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="showings-length"><p>May 2 at 6:30, 8:30, 10:30 &bull; May 3 at 3:00 &bull; 80m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Wendy and Lucy</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Kelly Reichardt, 2008</span> &bull; A twenty-something drifter from Indiana with only her retriever Lucy for company, Wendy heads to Alaska after the rumor of lucrative seasonal work in fisheries. Her ill-conceived plan falls apart when car trouble and a run-in with police strand her in a nondescript part of Oregon. In an intimate role, Michelle Williams is captivating, even at her bedraggled worst. Via her performance, Kelly Reichardt examines the lot of people who have slipped off the road of financial stability in an unassuming and timely depiction of life at the margins. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

<div class="movie">
	<a name="The_Wrestler"></a>
	<div class="showings-length"><p>May 8 at 6:30, 9:00, 11:30 &bull; May 10 at 1:00 &bull; 115m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>The Wrestler</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Darren Aronofsky, 2008</span> &bull; For most of his life, "The Ram" (Mickey Rourke) has sold his body to men seeking a fantasy where the USA always beats the Ayatollah. Today, he circles between his mobile home, a demeaning job, sparsely attended fan conventions, and a strip club. Pained by his inability to reconcile with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), he sparks a relationship with Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) a stripper, and begins to build a new life. This sensitive film from Darren Aronofsky elegizes the eighties and its people without sentimentalizing their culture of wish-fulfillment. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

<div class="movie">
	<a name="Gran_Torino"></a>
	<div class="showings-length"><p>May 9 at 7:00, 9:30 &bull; May 10 at 3:30 &bull; 116m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Gran Torino</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Clint Eastwood, 2008</span> &bull; Shunned at the Oscars, Clint Eastwood's latest film should not be ignored. After the death of his wife, Korean War vet Stanley Kowalski feels increasingly estranged from family and society. Spending the days downing beer on his porch, he watches broodingly as the old allAmerican neighborhood morphs into a community of Hmong immigrants. Nevertheless, his destiny soon converges inextricably with that of his new neighbors. Employing a cast of mostly local non-actors, Eastwood depicts the American psyche from many different cultural lenses. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="showings-length"><p>May 15 at 6:30, 9:00, 11:30 &bull; May 17 at 1:00 &bull; 119m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Revolutionary Road</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Sam Mendes, 2008</span> &bull; Adapted from Richard Yates's acclaimed novel, this Oscar-nominee reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in an on-screen tango of love and hate. As Frank and April Wheeler, a young suburban couple with children, they struggle to balance competing ambitions: to maintain a bourgeois life of responsibility and restraint, or to abandon convention and embark on bohemian adventures à Paris! Depicting the extreme loneliness of 50s American society and its "cult of domesticity", Sam Mendes (American Beauty) delivers one of the year's most thought-provoking films. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="showings-length"><p>May 16 at 7:00, 9:30 &bull; May 17 at 3:30 &bull; 128m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>The Class</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Laurent Cantet, 2008</span> &bull; Not since Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine (1995) has a film so politically relevant emerged from France. Originally titled Entre les murs (Between the Walls) and based on a novel by Fran&ccedil;ois B&eacute;gadeau, this verit&eacute; drama recounts one year at a suburban public school in Paris. But these aren't your white picket fence 'burbs: the Parisian banlieue is an urban ghetto marked by casual crime and racial tensions. Teacher Fran&ccedil;ois Marin must at once educate, empower and discipline his class of underprivileged teens. Recipient of the Palme d'Or at Cannes. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

	<div class="title"><p>SPECIAL EVENT: Director Pat O'Neill presents: The Decay of Fiction</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Pat O'Neill, 2002</span> &bull; Pat O'Neill's hallucinatory meditations on Hollywood take him to the abandoned Ambassador Hotel, site of Robert Kennedy's assassination and the first Oscar Ceremony. The narrative follows a year of violence and intrigue in the baroque, crumbling hotel. Part Sokurov, part Lynch, the film makes good on its title and unsettles the fictions that inflect the myth of Hollywood and its history. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p><p class="comments">Co-sponsored by the Open Practice Committee. Pat O'Neill will give a Q&A after the film, and will be introduced by Professor Tom Gunning.</p></div>

	<div class="title"><p>SPECIAL EVENT: Director James Benning presents the Chicago premiere of: RR</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">James Benning, 2007</span> &bull; A tribute to American freight infrastructure, an homage to the glorified visions of rail in the 20th century, and a nod to 21st century concerns about consumption, Benning's new feature consists of 43 long takes of trains passing through frames at varying speeds. Encompassing towns and cities, oceans and rivers, RR is a stunning portrait of America, which secures its creator's place as one of the country's preeminent filmmakers. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p><p class="comments">Director James Benning will introduce the film and give a Q&A afterwards.</p></div>

	<div class="showings-length"><p>May 29 at 7:00, 9:00, 11:00 &bull; May 31 at 1:00 &bull; 90m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Waltz with Bashir</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Ari Folman, 2008</span> &bull; When filmmaker Ari Folman realizes that he has no memory of his experiences as a young Israeli soldier in the 1982 Lebanon War, he embarks on a quest to track down and interview fellow veterans and piece together the truth about his involvement in the Sabra and Shatila massacres. This profoundly haunting film skirts the boundary between documentary and fiction. It is also a simply stunning piece of cell animation and analog craftsmanship in a digital age where the once proud Walt Disney Corporation has declared such techniques obsolete. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="movie">
	<a name="Notorious"></a>
	<div class="showings-length"><p>May 30 at 7:00, 9:30 &bull; May 31 at 3:30 &bull; 123m</p></div>
	<div class="title"><p>Notorious</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">George Tillman Jr., 2008</span> &bull; "...this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people... that called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter..." From Big Poppa's childhood in Brooklyn, to his cultivation as the savior of East Coast hip-hop, to his infamous feud with Tupac Shakur, and his tragic murder, this biopic offers a compelling portrayal of one of rap's most iconic and polarizing figures. Jamal Woolard is so convincing as The Notorious B.I.G. that Biggie's own mother reportedly swore she was watching her son. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

<div class="movie">
	<a name="Che_qParts_One_and_Twoq"></a>

	<div class="title"><p>Che (Parts One and Two)</p></div>
	<div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Steven Soderbergh, 2008</span> &bull; The first part of Steven Soderbergh's epic is triumphant, depicting Che Guevara (Benicio del Toro in a career performance) on his ascent to glory during the Cuban Revolution, and rise to prominence as an international icon. At Fidel Castro's right hand, Che becomes an inspirational guerrilla leader, caring for the wounded, training soldiers, and speaking before the United Nations. The treatment of the subject oscillates between electrifying reportage, carefully reenacting historical scenes, and lyrical contemplation, arresting the narrative to ponder the climate of Che's times. Che's second chapter finds the man leaving his family to lead a band of rebels in the Bolivian jungle in an effort to spark Marxist revolutions across South America. Tragically, Che fails to grasp the geopolitical dynamics of the region, and cannot convince the people of Bolivia of his sincerity. Sheer passion drives him to persevere, despite being outnumbered by both Bolivian and American forces. Soderbergh's hyperrealism plunges us into an asthmatic Guevara's dire final months as he and his tattered forces fight desperately for an already lost cause. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
