<h1> Spring 2009,  Thursday &bull; WTF?</h1>

<p class="seriesdesc">The God-damnedest things ever seen.</p><a href="#movies">Skip to the movie listings</a>

<div class="series-essay">

<p>When <b>Bill &amp; Coo</b>, a feature film with a cast made up entirely of actual birds in costumes, was released in 1948, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author James Agee was assigned to write a review. Flabbergasted by what he had seen, Agee declared the movie ``by conservative estimate, the goddamndest thing ever seen.'' This series presents that film, as well as nine other contenders for that title.</p>

<p>Although I initially assumed that the meaning of ``goddamndest'' was self-evident, from the blank expressions I received when pitching this series, I soon realized it would require some further explanation. I do this under a certain amount of protest: I believe the descriptor is as impossible to explain as the films it describes. These movies are movies so utterly bizarre that one cannot believe they are real. You see, part of what makes film so unique as an artistic medium is that, for the most part, it can only be created by a team of people. Writers, directors, actors, editors, right on down to caterers and drivers are involved in any given production, not to mention the producers and financial backers. It's impossible to imagine, then, that such a large group of people could collectively agree to devote days and weeks to create a western with only dwarf actors, as in <b>The</b> <b>Terror of Tiny Town</b>, or a serious film depicting a Communist decapitating a small child for refusing to stomp a picture of Jesus Christ, as in <b>If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?</b> But somehow, they happened. These are unaccountable films. These are films that should not exist. Yet, fortunately for us, they do.</p>

<p>The immediate conclusion a viewer may draw after seeing these movies is that they are not manmade at all, but are some sort of alien artifact &ndash; a parody of cinema made by some distant race with only vague familiarity with human and filmic conventions. Even if we are to assume that they do originate on Earth, one thing must be made clear about these films: they were not selected because they are ``so bad they're good.'' Yes, Edward D. Wood, Jr.'s <b>Glen or Glenda? </b>does not conform to any standard conception of how movies work. Yet what the viewer ought to walk away thinking about is not its incompetence, but it's inexplicableness. Wood did not intend to create a camp classic about transvestitism. He believed he was making an earnest explanation of a practice that to this day remains completely misunderstood. Yet how could he and his crew not realize how utterly strange an explanation it was?</p>

<p>Some of the films are quite expertly crafted, completely defying any sort of ``so bad it's good'' definition. David Lynch's <b>Eraserhead </b>is a revered classic, a surrealist masterpiece filmed over a period of five years as a student film project. Unlike in much of Lynch's later work, there is nothing one can call tongue-in-cheek here. Thirty years later, no one quite knows how its terrifying visual effects were created, lending credence to the theory that the movie was, in fact, produced extraterrestially. Likewise, <b>This Day and Age</b> was made by an accomplished and esteemed director &ndash; Cecil B. DeMille. Yet it's shockingly uncritical look at unspeakable mob violence &ndash; by upstanding teenage boys, no less &ndash; makes it hard to believe a major studio could have possibly agreed to make it. <b>Shanks</b>, meanwhile, is perhaps the best cinematic display of the late mime Marcel Marceau's tremendous talent that we have.</p>

<p>Often the obscurity of these films lends them a great deal of otherworldliness. Reviewing impossible to find movies like the 1930s self-flagellating religious cult thriller <b>The Lash of the Penitentes</b> or the disturbing all-star production of <b>Alice in Wonderland</b> makes us at Doc feel like we've just dug up some horrifying item that throws into chaos everything we know about how the universe functions. That is not to say there is not a certain amount of joy that comes with our discoveries. We have long talked about starting up a boutique DVD label under the Doc Films name with the sole purpose of releasing <b>Corn's-a-Poppin'</b> for a larger audience. The fact that its filmmakers and performers are so seemingly anonymous and lost to time is almost as jarring as the realization that one of its crewmembers is not anonymous at all &ndash; the script was co-authored by Robert Altman. Yet why did he neglect to discuss it in his book Altman on Altman?</p>

<p>In short, the goddamndest things ever seen might best be classified as outsider art. Like they're musical and artistic counterparts The Shaggs and Henry Darger, these films simply cannot be explained, and do not need to be.

  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 2 at 9:00 &bull; 65m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Glen or Glenda</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Ed Wood, 1953</span> &bull; The legendary Ed Wood offers this bizarrely incompetent attempt to explain his own penchant for transvestitism&mdash;particularly for angora sweaters. A morphine-addled Bela Legosi, spewing out nonsense in an inexplicable role as a scientist "pulling the strings" of the action, is the best actor of the cast, which even includes Wood himself as the titular Glen/Glenda. There is no discernible structure, and stock footage makes up a good chunk of the actual screen time. Yet despite his lack of technical or narrative skill, Wood's obvious sincerity is what makes the film so endearing. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 9 at 9:00 &bull; 58m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Corn's-a-Poppin</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Robert Woodburn, 1956</span> &bull; Widely considered by Doc programmers to be the most amazing discovery we have ever made, this country-and-western musical about popcorn, produced as far as we can tell by a semiprofessional Kansas City television crew, has a screenplay by Robert Altman. Yes, that Robert Altman. The plot has something to do with a popcorn manufacturer named Thaddeus Pinwhistle, a crooked PR man named Waldo Crummit, a singer named Lillian Gravelguard, etc. There are delightful songs about balloons and traveling to Mars, sometimes performed while the singers are pelted with popcorn.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="Alice_in_Wonderland"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 16 at 9:00 &bull; 75m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Alice in Wonderland</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Norman McLeod, 1933</span> &bull; Paramount's 1933 version takes Lewis Carroll's already strange tale even further with its bizarre all-star cast: W.C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty, Gary Cooper sporting a fake nose as the White Knight, Ned Sparks as the Caterpillar, Edward Everett Horton as the Mad Hatter, and Cary Grant wearing a turtleneck and, inexplicably, a horse's head as the Mock Turtle. The Fleischer studios provide an animated "The Walrus and the Carpenter" segment. Filled with special effect sequences that are both impressive and terrifying, this is a film surreal enough to please Charles Dodgson himself. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="This_Day_and_Age"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 23 at 9:00 &bull; 82m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>This Day and Age</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Cecil B. DeMille, 1933</span> &bull; One of the earliest and rarest of DeMille's sound features, <em>This Day and Age</em> is a wild paean to vigilante justice and mob violence masquerading as an inspirational high school story. When a few teenage boys witness the murder of a Jewish tailor at the hands of the local mob, they vow to take revenge by creating a grand coalition of all the high school students to do unspeakable things to the criminals' leader. The jawdroppingly insane plan they enact, followed by their triumphant victory march, has led more than one reviewer to compare the film to Hitler Youth propaganda. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="The_Lash_of_the_Penitentes"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>April 30 at 9:00 &bull; 65m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>The Lash of the Penitentes</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Zelma Carroll, 1937</span> &bull; Supposedly based on a true story, The Lash of the Penitentes is a lurid schockumentary about the murder of a newspaperman traveling to middle-of-nowhere New Mexico to investigate a strange sect of Catholics who engage in ritual self-flagellation. The film combines apparent documentary footage of the cult with fictionalized sequences, including a subplot about the reporter's guide's obsessive love for a local girl. It features depictions of brutal violence and frank sexuality, including scenes of nudity and crucifixions, that were shocking for its time and prevented the film from satisfying censors.  <span class="format">Archival 35mm</span></p></div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="Bill_and_Coo_&_Dogway_Melody"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 7 at 9:30 &bull; 61m, 17m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Bill and Coo & Dogway Melody</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Dean Reisner & Zion Myers, 1948 and Jules White, 1930</span> &bull; "Over 200 trained birds, complete with neckties, hats, etc., waddle around an anthropornithomorphic community called Chirpendale. By conservative estimate, the God-damnedest thing ever seen."&mdash;James Agee. Billed as "George Burton's Love Birds," the entire cast of <em>Bill and Coo</em> is made up of birds wearing costumes. When a raven (Curly Twiford's Jimmy the Crow) threatens the town, cabbie Bill Singer must save the day. The film won a special Oscar for its artistry and "patience." It screens with a musical starring dogs in costume, including a blackface Al Jolson dog. <span class="format"> DVD</span></p></div>

  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 14 at 9:00 &bull; 52m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Ron Ormond, 1971</span> &bull; After surviving a plane crash, exploitation filmmaker Ron Ormond experienced a spiritual reawakening and devoted himself to making Christian-based films. Inspired by the preachings of the eccentric Reverend Estus W. Pirkle, this incredible piece of Cold War-paranoia shows us a glimpse of where America is heading, with all its rock `n' roll and immorality. It depicts a sample of the violent acts against Christians that Communists will inevitably perpetrate once they take over, including an infamous scene where a child is beheaded for refusing to blaspheme. <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="The_Terror_of_Tiny_Town"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 21 at 9:00 &bull; 62m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>The Terror of Tiny Town</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Sam Newfield, 1938</span> &bull; A typical 1930s musical western in many respects&mdash;except that the cast is made up entirely of dwarves. They ride Shetland ponies and walk UNDER saloon doors. The plot involves an evil gunslinger named Bat Haines trying to incite conflict between two rival ranchers so that he can move in and steal their precious cattle. It's up to the heroic Buck Lawson to save the tiny town. The stars of this terribly un-PC camp classic, credited as "Jed Buell's Midgets," would go on to greater fame the following year as the Munchkins in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. <span class="format"> 16mm</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="Eraserhead"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>May 28 at 9:30 &bull; 100m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>Eraserhead</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">David Lynch, 1978</span> &bull; Set against the nightmarish backdrop of a desolate industrial world, David Lynch's debut is an otherworldly masterpiece. Henry (Jack Nance) learns that he has impregnated his girlfriend Mary, who has given birth prematurely to a baby... of sorts. <em>Eraserhead</em> is both Lynch's strangest and his most accessible film: through the disturbing imagery lies a very real and personal expression of the dread of paternity. The incredible sound design by Lynch and Alan Splet is a character of its own&mdash;combining bizarre drones with Fats Waller organ music, and climaxing in the haunting song of the Lady in the Radiator. <span class="format"> DVD</span></p></div>

<div class="movie">
  <a name="Independence_Day"></a>
  <div class="showings-length"><p>June 4 at 9:30 &bull; 145m</p></div>
  <div class="title"><p>SPECIAL EVENT: Independence Day</p></div>
  <div class="desc"><p><span class="dir-date">Roland Emmerich, 1996</span> &bull; Following the standing-room-only success of last year's Doc finale, <em>Jurassic Park</em>, we present a special screening of Jeff Goldblum's other great blockbuster. <em>ID4</em> follows the multiple interweaving storylines of several characters who must come together to save the human race from a coordinated alien attack. It's like Robert Altman, only shitty! Bill Pullman, naturally cast as the President of the United States, leads an all-star cast that also includes Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Vivica A. Fox, the guy from <em>Taxi</em>, the brother from <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>, and Lt. Cmdr. Data. Plus, special pre-show entertainment! <span class="format"> 35mm</span></p></div>
