While the ruffledartist Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli) huffs and puffs through the motions ofmasterpiece-romanticism, tasks are placed on equal planes and pinning thecanvas becomes as important as painting it. The screen remains in-process withconstant inscriptions on the soundtrack: cicadas stir the leaves, a fountainpen scratches a sketchbook to release its ink, a bell rings in the distance;the film reminds us of the air within the belfry before the hammer hits.<spanstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br />October 13<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Seventh Continent</span><br />Michael Haneke, 1989<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>111m<p>A jarring, hollowed-out work from the director of theprovocative Code Unknown (2000).&nbsp;Based on various news reports and events,this feature casts a cold eye on the everyday ups and downs of a middle classfamily in Austria. &nbsp;Waiting for their favorite television programs to reachsyndication, browsing the magazine racks at the supermarket, the householdyearns for a continent undiscovered by travel agencies. &nbsp;Until then thefamily car needs to be washed again, the alarm clock obeyed, and the billspaid. &nbsp;The methodical pace creates a numbing effect that builds to adisturbing and shocking conclusion. &nbsp;<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br />October 20<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick</span><br />Wim Wenders, 1971 <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span>101m<p>Joseph Bloch, an off-duty football goalkeeper, has no matchto win. He watches a movie he's seen before, drinks too much at the bar, andfalls down in the rain. He makes a sandwich and commits a murder before findingfascination in the mechanics of a jukebox. It's the last line of defense:&quot;It's very difficult to stop watching the action, to keep your eyes on thegoalkeeper as he patiently waits for the play to come his way; your eyes keepgoing back, following the forwards.&quot; &nbsp;Based on the novel by PeterHandke, who co-wrote Wings of Desire with Wenders.</span><p><br />October 27<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Walkabout</span><br />Nicolas Roeg, 1971<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>95m<p>A family picnic goes awry, forcing a teenage girl and heryounger brother to fend for themselves in the vast Australian outback. Orphansin school uniforms, the two become reluctant bricoleurs, making a stick functionas a faucet and tying knots in a blanket until it tightens as aknapsack.&nbsp;Roeg's photographic zeal and dynamic editing make the desertlandscape a complex terrain and the camera recalls flashes of flesh with onlyoccasional moments of preciousness. To complain of Roeg's heavy hand is to missthe insect-scurrying edge upon which the film rests, even if condominiums andpools are never far away. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span>35mm<spanstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span></span><p><br />November 3<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">The Gleaners and I</span><br />Agnes Varda, 2000<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>82m<p>Gleaners pick at already-harvested fields for the odd potatoor turnip; they insist on finding a use for material that is considered unfitby others.&nbsp;Varda's unburdened camera tactics (digital video imagestransferred to 35mm) glide fromthe forgotten corners of the French countryside to the off-hours at the greenmarkets in Paris.&nbsp;An added bonus is the work of artist Sarah Sze, whosepieces appear to continue growing long after they have been installed. Szeappreciates a spot where a tiny box of crayon-colored tacks once hung from arack in a pharmacy that is on the verge of becoming a franchise. &nbsp;<spanstyle='mso-tab-count:2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br />November 10<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Belfast, Maine</span><br />Frederick Wiseman, 1999 <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>248m<p>America's great documentary filmmaker, Frederick Wiseman,depicts life in a New England port city, with an emphasis on the town'seconomic dependence on the seafood industry.&nbsp;He captures the tasks oflobstermen, tug-boat operators, shop-owners, choir directors, judges,policemen, teachers, nurses, and ministers. &nbsp;The characters proceed inearnest, and yet a sense of waiting hovers over many of the portraits. Theviewer goes from the motion of machines at a fish packing plant to a morningbefore a bakery opens. Traffic signals sway over empty streets, and there issomething Hopper-like in the early morning light.</span><p><br />November 17<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Celine and Julie Go Boating</span><br />Jacques Rivette, 1974<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span>193m<p>From French New Wave giant Jacques Rivette (Va Savoir,L'Amour Fou) comes this magical and dream-like film, whose title can also betranslated as Celine and Julie Go Crazy. Celine (Juliet Bertot, who co-wrotethe script) and Julie (Dominique Labourier) meet two ghostly women while in ahaunted house. The progression of time threatens their intimacy and the girlsdecide to return to their childhood in order to alter the past. Jean-MarieSŽnia's exquisite soundtrack works in everyday sounds, such as heels clickingagainst the pavement and the purr of taxi motors. <span style='mso-tab-count:2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br />November 24<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Van Gogh</span><br />Maurice Pialat, 1991<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>155m<p>Pialat's film desentimentalizes the madness that has oftenoverwhelmed Van Gogh's biography. &nbsp;Accumulated details create a sense ofimmediacy, allowing commonplace objects and actions to resonate at the expenseof the narrative. &nbsp;History is heard through heavy coins sliding across acounter or the reflex knock on a kneecap that resounds only within the silenceof a 19th Century doctor's office. &nbsp;Van Gogh (Jacques Dutronc) exists inthe gaps between working and living, spending time staring into space, whilePialat reverses steps and creates staccato movements to construct a cinema ofwalking.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<spanstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span></span><p><br />December 1<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Jeanne Dielman </span><br />Chantal Akerman, 1975 <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>198m<p>Focusing on a housewife who turns tricks before settingsilverware for the family dinner, director Chantal Akerman and cinematographerBabette Mangolte use long, wide-angle shots that give everyday rituals anunnerving and defamiliarizing impact. Everyday sounds, objects, and actionsreverberate beyond their function, creating blocks of noise, stasis, andmovement.&nbsp;Coffee beans are ground to abstraction; the percolator is anhourglass where drips mark the minutes.&nbsp;Later, a meatloaf will weigh downan already claustrophobic kitchen. Jeanne peers beyond her tabletop as thoughits edge were a precipice. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><a name="post"></a><p><span class="series">Post-War German Cinema</span><p><br />September 30<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Lissy</span><br />Konrad Wolf, 1957<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>89m<p>This film focuses on Lissy Schroder, a young departmentstore clerk caught up in the political turmoil of Germany in the early 1930s.Her husband joins the Nazi Party after a conflict with his Jewish boss, and hissentiments are not uncommon in their working-class Berlin surroundings. Berlinof the 1930s-- Berlin of Brown Shirts, Berthold Brecht and bold caberet-- comesalive in detail and mood as a background for personal relationships in Lissy.Konrad Wolf, one of the founders and most highly acclaimed directors of DEFAStudios, had escaped Germany in 1933 and returned in 1954.</span><p><br />October 7<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Divided Heaven</span><br />Konrad Wolf, 1964<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>109m<p>Produced during the brief cultural thaw of the early 1960s,this film was strongly influenced by Alain Resnais' Hiroshima mon amour in form andin its exploration of the dangerous quest for a female identity against thebackdrop of momentous historical events. In this case, it is the building ofthe Berlin Wall that divided East from West Berlin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With its bold cinematic fragmentation, Divided Heavenanticipated the bans imposed on numerous films in 1965 for displaying too manyof the objectionable qualities of decadent Western "new wave" movements.Divided Heaven disappeared deep into the archives to be rediscovered only after Germany's reunification.</span><p><br />October 14<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">A Call Girl Named Rosemarie</span><br />Rolf Thiele, 1959<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>100m<p>In 1957, a Frankfurt call girl named Rosemarie Nitribitt wasmurdered. It soon was revealed that her services were highly regarded in someof West Germany's most prominent industrial circles and the Nitribitt case wasnever solved. When this film was chosen to represent West Germany at the VeniceFilm Festival, the German Foreign Ministry vigorously protested - and it'slittle wonder why. The film marks the highpoint in the career of Nadja Tiller,who received offers to work with, among others, Antonioni, Fellini and Visconti- all of which she refused.</span><p><br />October 21<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Trace of Stones</span><br />Frank Beyer, 1966<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>139m<p>Banned by the East German government for its portrayal ofworking conditions in their country, Trace of Stones provides an excellentvisual document of the mid-1960s GDR. Hannes Ballas (Manfred Krug) is theundisputed leader at the Schkonka construction site, using unconventionalmethods to compensate for theerrors and incompetence of the party-appointed administration. When a new partyofficial takes over at theconstruction site, the status quo seems jeopardized. Eventually, the new mancomes around to seeing things Ballas' way, but by this time Ballas findshimself in trouble for an extra-marital love affair with a new engineer.<spanstyle='mso-tab-count:2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br />October 28<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Yesterday Girl</span><br />Alexander Kluge, 1966<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>88m<p>A key film that helped launch New German Cinema, Kluge'sstunning first feature follows Anita Giestern, a Jewish refugee from EastGermany who commits petty theft as she finds her way through an inhospitableFederal Republic hoping for a better life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><br /><span class="title">The Middle of the Road is a Very Dead End</span><br />A.

Herr R. lives aperfectly normal life: he gives his wife all the money her social aspirationsdemand, he visits his parents, he talks to his son'steachers and friends. Yet hecommits, without warning, a mosthorrendous act of violence. </span><br /><span class="title">Chinese Roulette</span><br />Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1976<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>86m<p>An unfaithful couple, their disabled daughter and her dumbgoverness, a housekeeper and her son all come together at a country house.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fassbinder creates a psychologicalballet that ultimately unfolds through the game of Chinese roulette.</span><p><br />November 11<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">The Naked Man on the Athletic Field</span><br />Konrad Wolf, 1974<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>99m<p>Solo Sunny</span><br />Konrad Wolf, 1979<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>102m<p>Sunny is a pop singer in a mediocre band who longs to behappy and recognized as someone special. After she gets kicked out of the bandshe starts over in the underground scene in East Berlin. This film addressedthe longings of East German Youth while capturing the GDR version of '70s stylein its gritty-glitzy visuals and its soundtrack. Its success promised ayouthful renewal in DEFA, yet two discoveries among its youth talent, RenateKrš§ner and Eberhard Geick, pursued their careers in the West.35mm<p><p><br />November 18<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Ticket of No Return</span><br />Ulrike Ottinger, 1979<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span>108m<p>Social parody and exaggeration dominate the work of theavant-guard feminist Ulrike Ottinger. <span style='mso-tab-count:2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p>REDUPERS</span><br />Helke Sander, 1977<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>98m<p>"Most women work harder than men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They do things they want to do when they have already spentsixty hours working on something else," said Sander, who both directed andplayed the leading role in her first fiction film. The film reveals three daysin the life of a woman and a photographer, and three days in<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>West Berlin in March 1977. Itbrilliantly questions the construction of the identities of both the women andthe city.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br />November 25<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Ludwig, Requiem for a Virgin King</span><br />Hans-JŸrgen Syberberg, 1972<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>134m<p>The first in his trilogy (followed by Karl May and Hitler, aFilm from Germany), Syberberg presents this wildly eclectic meditation onLudwig II of Bavaria, who was a homosexual, drug addict, Francophile, and pacifistwho built story-book castles and supported Richard Wagner. Germanic culturaland political allusions combine into a visually arresting and intellectuallychallenging film structured in 28 chapters. It references recent German history(Hitler) with German culture (particularly music and especially Wagner) toprobe the seeming incompatibility of beauty and cruelty.</span><p><br />December 2<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Germany, Pale Mother</span><br />Helma Sanders-Brahms, 1979<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>149m<p>Sanders-Brahms, a descendant of Johannes Brahms, used herchildhood and her mother's life at the time of the Second World War as thesource for Germany, Pale Mother. Titled after Bertolt Brecht's poem, thiscontroversial and moving account begins with the courtship of a young couple onthe eve of the German invasion of Poland, through the war, where mother anddaughter build a bond in the father's absence, and into the post-war period.The film takes an extremely personal perspective as it struggles not only withthe historical issues of the war on the German side, but also the relationshipbetween mother and daughter.</span><p><br /><a name="rock"></a><p><span class="series">Rockumentary</span><p><br />October 1<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Don't Look Back</span><br />D.A.

And while Dylan plays sphinx to an endless stream ofreporters and works on his metamorphosis from down-to-earth folkie to withdrawnrocker, Pennebaker's hands-off style lets us watch Dylan's mask slip as hestruggles between affection and disaffection. This is Bob Dylan "at his mostdespotic, a gaunt silhouette with stovepipe legs and a fabulous corona ofunkempt hair," says Janet Maslin. As enjoyable for Dylan's harrowing attacks onthe press as it is for his music.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><br />October 8<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Monterey Pop</span><br />D.A.

The film documents the Stones'infamous concert at Altamount Speedway, which resulted in four deaths,including the murder of Meredith Hunter by a group of Hell's Angels hired toact as security for the concert. Members of the Stones helped edit the film,and one senses the ominous mood that permeated production of the film.Including amazing live performances by Tina Turner, Jerry Garcia, and theStones, the film presents the era in its glorious, grisly, decadent whole. <spanstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br />October 22<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Last Waltz</span><br />Martin Scorsese, 1978<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>117m<p>It is The Band's last concert, and it's going to be a wildride. It's Thanksgiving Day, 1976, and The Band has been going for more thanfifteen years.

Yet, for its short lifetime the band provided asoundtrack for a British population plagued by unemployment and socialupheaval. They also cursed at thepress, spat on their audience, got banned from TV, and used enough drugs tomake any punk rocker proud. The Filth and the Fury is the third documentary ofthe rise and lightning quick demise of the band, this time, from the viewpointsof the band members themselves (rather than their self-promoting manager,Malcolm McLaren.) Rare performance footage and wickedly funny interviews makethis film a rollicking good joy ride. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br />November 5<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">The Decline of Western Civilization</span><br />Penelope Spheeris, 1981<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>100m<spanstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><br />While many know Director Penelope Spheeris from Wayne's World, it was her earlier work and knowledgeof music that landed her that job. Her directorial debut, The Decline ofWestern Civilization, descends to the depths of the L.A. punk scene of the early 1980s.Spheeris follows Circle Jerks, Fear's Finale, X, The Germs, Alice Bag Band, andCatholic Discipline from their night club venues to their homes. The Germs'Darby Crash reveals his drug abuse in candid terms, while lamenting hisostracism from venues where he had previously performed.

Long shots (some lasting almost a minute) allow theaudience to enjoy the full visual impact of performance art presentations of "Psycho Killer," "Once in aLifetime," and "Heaven."

When asked about theloss of fans, manager Ian Faith dismisses the comment - the fans are simplybecoming more "selective". Their tour is an overly-theatrical, expensivedisaster; the band's members quarrel like prima donnas; and the album is aflop.

As always,Sayles forefronts issues of modern America, such as the conflicts betweenconglomerates and small businesses, and progress and regression.<spanstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>35mm<p><p><br /><a name="matinee"></a><p><span class="series">Sunday Matinee</span><p><br />October 6<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">Minority Report</span></p><p>October 13<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">Signs</span></p><p>October 20<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">Insomnia</span></p><p>October 27<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">The Thin Red LIne</span></p><p>November 3<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">Donnie Darko</span></p><p>November 10<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">Road to Perdition</span></p><p>November 17<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</span></p><p>November 24<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">24 Hour Party People</span></p><p>December 1<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2:00<br /><span class="title">Maelstr&ouml;m</span><p></td></tr></table><p><br><span class="copy">&copy; 2000-2001 Doc Films &amp; The University of Chicago </span>        </td><td valign="top"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="110">            <tr>                <td valign="top"><a onmouseover="document['fpAnimswapImgFP6'].imgRolln=document['fpAnimswapImgFP6'].src;document['fpAnimswapImgFP6'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP6'].lowsrc;" onmouseout="document['fpAnimswapImgFP6'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP6'].imgRolln" href="calendar.html"><img border="0" src="calendar1.gif" id="fpAnimswapImgFP6" name="fpAnimswapImgFP6" dynamicanimation="fpAnimswapImgFP6" lowsrc="calendar2.gif" width="180" height="78"></a><br>                  <a onmouseover="document['fpAnimswapImgFP1'].imgRolln=document['fpAnimswapImgFP1'].src;document['fpAnimswapImgFP1'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP1'].lowsrc;" onmouseout="document['fpAnimswapImgFP1'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP1'].imgRolln" href="events.html"><img border="0" src="special1.gif" id="fpAnimswapImgFP1" name="fpAnimswapImgFP1" dynamicanimation="fpAnimswapImgFP1" lowsrc="special2.gif" width="180" height="78"></a><br>                  <a onmouseover="document['fpAnimswapImgFP3'].imgRolln=document['fpAnimswapImgFP3'].src;document['fpAnimswapImgFP3'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP3'].lowsrc;" onmouseout="document['fpAnimswapImgFP3'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP3'].imgRolln" href="directions.html"><img border="0" src="directions1.gif" id="fpAnimswapImgFP3" name="fpAnimswapImgFP3" dynamicanimation="fpAnimswapImgFP3" lowsrc="directions2.gif" width="180" height="78"></a><br>                  <a onmouseover="document['fpAnimswapImgFP5'].imgRolln=document['fpAnimswapImgFP5'].src;document['fpAnimswapImgFP5'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP5'].lowsrc;" onmouseout="document['fpAnimswapImgFP5'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP5'].imgRolln" href="volunteer.html">                  <img border="0" src="volunteers1.gif" id="fpAnimswapImgFP5" name="fpAnimswapImgFP5" dynamicanimation="fpAnimswapImgFP5" lowsrc="volunteers2.gif" width="180" height="78"></a><br>                  <a onmouseover="document['fpAnimswapImgFP4'].imgRolln=document['fpAnimswapImgFP4'].src;document['fpAnimswapImgFP4'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP4'].lowsrc;" onmouseout="document['fpAnimswapImgFP4'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP4'].imgRolln" href="about.html">                  <img border="0" src="about1.gif" id="fpAnimswapImgFP4" name="fpAnimswapImgFP4" dynamicanimation="fpAnimswapImgFP4" lowsrc="about2.gif" width="180" height="78"></a><br>                  <a onmouseover="document['fpAnimswapImgFP2'].imgRolln=document['fpAnimswapImgFP2'].src;document['fpAnimswapImgFP2'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP2'].lowsrc;" onmouseout="document['fpAnimswapImgFP2'].src=document['fpAnimswapImgFP2'].imgRolln" href="index.html">                  <img border="0" src="home1.gif" id="fpAnimswapImgFP2" name="fpAnimswapImgFP2" dynamicanimation="fpAnimswapImgFP2" lowsrc="home2.gif" width="180" height="78">                  </a><br>                </td>            </tr>        </table>        </td>    </tr></table></body></html>
