<p>September 27 7:00<br />
  <span class="title">Open Hearts</span> <br />
Susanne Bier, 2002 113m </p>
<p>When her fianc&eacute; is paralyzed from a car accident, Cecilie (Sonja Richter) finds more than just comfort in the arms of a married hospital doctor. The dogme 95 film takes a turn towards the melodramatic when the doctor's wife is revealed to be the other person in the car accident. Although "tragic accident" and "adulterous affairs" may seem like the stuff of soap operas, Bier's film transcends those conventions by focussing on the responsibility the lovers feel for those they are leaving behind. A very popular filmmaker in her native country of Denmark, this is Bier's first work to reach the states. 35mm</p><p>October 4 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Elling </span><br />
Petter N&#230;ss, 2001 89m </p>
<p>Elling is the story of a middle-aged man who is forced to finally grow up. After his mom/roommate dies, Elling can't cope and is sent to a state facility. His roommate turns out to be Kjell, a 40-year-old virgin obsessed with sex. Two years later, the friends give the real world a try again, with hilarious results. Their adventures in writing, sex, and car ownership are both funny and dark. The screenwriter, Axel Hellstenius, created the film out of a series of Norwegian short stories. One of the highest grossing Norwegian films of all time, Elling was nominated for a foreign language Oscar. 35mm </p><p>October 11 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">N&oacute;i albon&oacute;i </span><br />
Dagur K&aacute;ri, 2003 93m</p>
<p> Like many people who live in vast but sparsely populated areas, N&oacute;i is lonely. And, like many Icelanders, his isolation doesn't prevent him from being a hipster. This tale of N&oacute;i's senior year of high school&mdash;the challenges of living with a grandmother who uses a shotgun as an alarm clock, falling in love in the shadow of ice mountains&mdash;is incredibly moving. It also features a beautiful trip through a taxidermy museum. <em>N&oacute;i albon&oacute;i</em> swept international award festivals, not only picking up statues for its acting and cinematography, but also for its original sound track. Director K&aacute;ri is also in the band slowbow, which scored the film. Those Icelanders! </p>
<p>October 18 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">101 Reykjavik</span><br />
Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, 2000 88m </p>
<p>This "Icelandic slacker film" is probably the most widely viewed Icelandic film ever. The slacker is 28-year-old Hulfner, who lives with his mom on welfare. Things heat up when his mother and girlfriend start having an affair and everyone is forced to reconsider what makes a family. This film is more than just a black comedy, it's a fun look into the more nontraditional dynamics of Icelandic relationships. Director Korm&aacute;kur, who was previously a popular Icelandic actor, took the title from the address of his bar (and home) in Reykjavik. </p>
<p>October 25 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Together </span><br />
Lukas Moodysson, 2000 106m </p>
<p><em>Together</em> chronicles the funny, yet sad and boring moments of living in a Swedish commune in the mid-1970s. Moodysson (<em>Lilya 4-ever</em>) indulges in lots of period details (yes, there is ABBA music), but focuses his attention on the characters, particularly those of Elisabeth and her children, who move to the commune to escape her alcoholic husband. This film escapes easy idealizing or bashing of the commune experience, instead approaching it thoughtfully. Like many Swedish films, <em>Together</em> is both very serious and very funny. </p>
<p>November 1 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Songs from the Second Floor</span> <br />
Roy Andersson, 2000 98 m </p>
<p>After spending 25 years making "the best TV commercials in the world" (so said Ingmar Bergman) Andersson created this particularly non-commercial film. A series of loosely connected scenes are set in a European city, dulled by an unknown economic crisis. Inside this almost static drabness, Andersson creates scenes of extreme originality and humor using a cast of nonprofessional, but excellent, actors (Lars Nordh, one of the main actors, was discovered by Anderson at an IKEA store). The film takes a typically critical approach to materialism, but in the most atypical of ways. 35mm </p>
<p>November 8 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">The Man Without a Past </span><br />
Aki Kaurism&auml;ki, 2002 97m</p>
<p> Kaurism&auml;ki is probably the most popular Finnish filmmaker and this film is one of his very best. It tells the story of a traveling salesman who is beaten up by a couple of thugs while on a business trip. He wakes up in a poor, remote town, unable to remember who he is, yet still able to seduce a lonely Salvation Army worker. Typical of the director's films, this one features an amazing sound track of Finnish rock and lounge music. It also features "Tahti", the famous dog actress. The best part about Kaurism&auml;ki's films are his quirky characters living on the edge of society, something much admired by his biggest fan, Jim Jarmusch. 35mm </p>
<p>November 15 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Mifune</span> <br />
Soren Kragh-Jacobsen, 1999 99m </p>
<p>The third film to come out of Denmark's Dogme school, <em>Mifune</em> tells the story of Kresten, a rising businessman in Copenhagen, who has just married his boss's daughter. He hasn't told her&mdash;or anyone&mdash;that he came from a poor farming family. On their honeymoon, Kresten finds out that his father died, and he returns home to look after the family farm and care for his mentally disabled brother. He places an ad for a housekeeper, which is answered by a prostitute named Liva, who is trying to escape a psychotic client and make money for her brother's school tuition. A heartwarming and fresh study on the conflicting pulls of success and family roots. </p>
<p>November 22 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Italian for Beginners </span><br />
Lone Scherfig 118m </p>
<p>For those who thought that Dogme filmaking was all about Bjork and hankerchiefs, this film is bound to be a surprise. An actual Dogme romantic comedy, Italian for Beginners follows the lives of several students taking an intro Italian class in a suburb of Copenhagen. The film mostly follows their interactions in the classroom complex, but also on a trip to Venice, where the characters are revealed in a new light. Director and writer Scherfig (Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself) mantains the intimacy that Dogme filmaking allows&mdash;to the point that the viewer almost feels involved in the action&mdash;but adds a welcome touch of lightness and humor. 35mm</p>
<p>November 29 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Insomnia</span> <br />
Erik Skjoldbj&#230;rg, 1997 97m </p>
<p>At first <em>Insomnia</em> may seem like the typical murder mystery movie, but it quickly becomes something much more. In an excellent performance, Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd (<em>Breaking the Waves</em> and <em>Good Will Hunting</em>) plays Jonas Engstr&ouml;m, an Oslo cop sent to a small town in Northern Norway to solve the mystery of a teenage girls' death. But things go wrong from the beginning and Engstr&ouml;m finds himself struggling not only to find the killer, but to save himself. Skjoldbj&#230;rg uses the perpetual daylight and cold atmosphere of Norway to great effect. Even if you have seen the 2001 remake, this original version of the film will surprise and shock you. (Plus, this one's better.) </p>

<p>September 28 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">The Sorrow and the Pity </span><br />
  Marcel Oph&uuml;ls, 1971 260m</p>
<p>Arguably the best documentary ever made, this film is probably best known for two reasons: it was Woody Allen's date movie in <em>Annie Hall</em> and it is important to French constructions of history. Originally banned from TV by the French government, it challenged the then-prevalent myth in France of heroic resistance to the Nazi occupation. It is a collage in which Marcel Oph&uuml;ls, son of director Max Oph&uuml;ls, intersperses contemporary newsreel footage and propaganda films into dozens of interviews with French, British, and German citizens, soldiers, former Nazis, members of the resistance, and collaborators. </p><p>October 5 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">The Battle of Algiers </span><br />
Gillo Pontecorvo, 1965 120m </p>
<p>Pontecorvo's seminal docu-drama depicting the events leading to Algerian independence in 1962 is a work of stunning realism, heavily employing amateur actors while imitating a newsreel style. The narrative focuses on the massive rebellion launched by the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) between 1954 and 1957, showing the organization of the resistance movement and the tactics used by the French to destroy it. Pontecorvo was effectively on the side of the Algerian rebels, yet he eschews glamorization of either side in the conflict. New Print! 35mm </p>
<p>October 12 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Franz Fanon: Black Skin, White Mask</span> <br />
Isaac Julien, 1996 70m </p>
<p>Julien explores the life and work of one of the 20th century's pre-eminent theorists on race, colonialism, and identity. Born in Martinique and educated in France, Fanon was a psychiatrist in Algeria who eventually joined the FLN. Transformed by these experiences, he authored revolutionary theories on the psychological relationship between the colonized and colonizer. Julien integrates readings of Fanon's work, reenactments of key moments in his life, and interviews with friends, family, and cultural theorists, illuminating the implications of his ideas in the contemporary world. </p>
<p>October 19 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Arna's Children </span><br />
Juliano Mer-Khamis &amp; D. Danniel, 2003 84 m </p>
<p><em>Arna's Children</em> follows a children's theater group, established by the Isr&#230;li Arna Mer-Khamis, in the West Bank town of Jenin. Drawing from footage recorded during rehearsal periods from 1989 to 1996, Juliano focuses on the lives of a few of the children. He then returns to see what has happened to them following the notorious battle in Jenin in 2002. This provocative documentary is an intense look at both terrorism and the Isr&#230;li occupation. </p>
<p><span class="title">Like Twenty Impossibles</span> <br />
Annemarie Jacir, 2003 17m </p>
<p>Palestinian filmmakers try to enter Jerusalem after a chekpoint closes, revealing the indignity of life in occupied territories. </p>
<p>October 26 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Untamagiru</span> <br />
Takamine Go, 1989 120m </p>
<p>A post-colonial rendition of an Okinawan folk-myth, this film is set in 1969, three years before Okinawa was returned to Japan after 27 years of American occupation. Giru is a sugar factory worker in love with the pig-incarnate daughter of his boss, Nishihara. When Nishihara threatens to kill him, Giru flees to the forest, where a spirit endows him with superhuman powers. Using his newfound capacities, he steals from the rich to give to the poor, sabotaging both American and Japanese economic interests. Deftly employing color, song, and dance, this hilarious film explores the culture and identity of Okinawa and its relationship with its historic occupiers. </p>
<p>November 2 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Emitai </span><br />
Ousmane Sembene, 1971 103m </p>
<p>Senegalese director Ousmane Sembene, often considered the father of African cinema, is known for his emphasis on historical interpretation and his criticism of local corruption. Based on a confrontation that occurred during World War II between the inhabitants of a Diola village in Senegal and the French military, this film reveals the tragic role of military collaboration. After the colonial government conscripts the young men in the village as soldiers, it demands a tax payment in rice to feed the army. Led by the women and elders, the villagers refuse, and a conflict ensues. The final scene was blacked out by the French government, and the film was banned in Senegal after its release. 35mm </p>
<p>November 9 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Gandhi </span><br />
Richard Attenborough, 1982 187m </p>
<p>Beginning with Mahatma Gandhi's assassination in 1948 at the hands of Nathuram Godse, and then rewinding to 1890s South Africa, the film stars Ben Kingsley (in his most memorable role) as <em>Gandhi</em>, a Westernized lawyer with reformist goals fighting for the civil rights of Indians as citizens within the British Empire. Attenborough succeeds in conveying Gandhi's charismatic authority, his political intellect, and the role of his peculiar mix of Western liberalism and Hindu philosophy in the form of his philosophy of nonviolence. This film won 8 of the 11 Academy Awards that it was nominated for, including best actor and best film. 35mm </p>
<p>November 16 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Burn! </span><br />
Gillo Pontecorvo, 1970 112 m </p>
<p><em>Burn!</em> is Pontecorvo's sequel to Battle of Algiers, and serves as an allegory for the then-ongoing U.S. intervention in Vietnam. Sir William Walker (Marlon Brando) is a British agent hired to provoke a slave revolt against the Portuguese in the fictional colony of Queimada in the Antilles in the mid-19th century. Seeking to make room for British economic interests, he incites Jose Dolores, a water porter, to lead the insurrection. Ten years later he returns, hired by a British authority, the Antilles Royal Sugar Company, to quell a revolt of sugar plantation workers led by Dolores. This often-overlooked performance from the late Brando is superb. 16mm </p>
<p>November 23 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance</span> <br />
Alanis Obomsawin, 1993 120m </p>
<p>In 1990, the municipality of Oka, Quebec approved a plan to develop a luxury housing complex and golf course that would appropriate land from the nearby Mohawk reservation. In response, the Mohawks staged a protest that developed into a historic confrontation with Quebec's police and the Canadian Army, initiating a self-determination movement among indigenous groups throughout Canada. Obomsawin recorded the extraordinary footage from the Mohawk side of the barricades over a grueling 78-day standoff. She also documents the contemporary political and social structure of the reservation inhabitants. 35mm  </p>
<p>November 30 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Rabbit-Proof Fence</span> <br />
Phillip Noyce, 2002 93m </p>
<p>Until 1970, the Australian government forcibly removed "half-castes" (children of both Aboriginal and white descent) from their homes, in hopes that their Aboriginal roots could be gradually "stamped out" via integration into white society. This film is based on the exceptional story of three such children of the so-called "Stolen Generations." Placed in a dormitory in 1931 to be trained as servants, the girls escape and attempt to find their way back home by following a rabbit-proof fence that runs across the continent. 35mm</p>

<p>September 29 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Hometown </span><br />
  Kenji Mizoguchi, 1930 86m </p>
<p>Mizoguchi's first talkie, this melodrama concerns an ambitious singer (played by famous opera tenor Yoshie Fujiwara) and the conflict between artistic integrity and his desire for fame and fortune. When his first record becomes a hit, success goes to his head, and he begins to ignore his loyal girlfriend in favor of his patron, a rich society woman. This fascinating early work deals with such characteristic Mizoguchi themes as the perils of ambition and the ubiquity of female-sacrifice. It also contains striking examples of Mizoguchi's experimentation with Western cinematic techniques such as tracking, dolly shots, montage sequences, and close-ups. Archival print. 35mm </p><p>October 6 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums</span> <br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1939 142m </p>
<p>In 19th century Tokyo, a young Kabuki actor from a prominent theatrical family discovers that he is praised because of his connections, not his talent. Determined to succeed on his own merits, he leaves home, accompanied only by a loving young female servant who believes in his art. Constructed with the fluid camerawork and graceful long shots that were to become the director's hallmark, this exquisite shinpa tragedy about female self-sacrifice and the pursuit of artistic excellence is perhaps the greatest of Mizoguchi's prewar efforts. 35mm </p>
<p>October 13 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">The 47 Ronin, Pts. I and II</span> <br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1941 219m </p>
<p>Based on Japan's most popular samurai legend, this film, which was not seen in the West until 1979, was made at the government's behest and conceived as nationalist propaganda. A lord is dishonored by his enemies. His men, reduced to the lowly status of ronin (masterless samurai), then seek vengeance for their master's humiliation. Mizoguchi downplayed the story's action and violence in favor of contemplation and emotion. Of the many film versions of the story, this one, with its striking visuals, careful attention to character, and moving images of loyalty and self-sacrifice, is generally considered the greatest. Archival print. 35mm </p>
<p>October 20 7:00<br />
  <span class="title">My Love Has Been Burning </span><br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1949 84m </p>
<p>This film, part of Mizoguchi's "fighting women" trilogy, is probably his most explicitly feminist work. Loosely based on the autobiography of Eiko Kageyama (Kinuyo Tanaka), a late 19th century crusader for women's rights, the film follows Kageyama as she leaves her job as a schoolteacher, becomes involved in the new Liberal Party in Tokyo, and struggles to reconcile her feminism with her relationships with men. Distinguished by its remarkably modern sexual politics, the film is unsparing in its exposure of the hypocritical private lives of the "progressive" male politicians. It ends with a hauntingly powerful image of solidarity between two women. 35mm </p>
<p>October 27 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Life of Oharu</span> <br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1952 148m </p>
<p>Mizoguchi considered this to be his finest work, and it was his first film to gain international renown. Based on a 17th century novel, it tells the story of Oharu (Kinuyo Tanaka), a lady of the imperial court who, following an illicit affair with a lower class page, is exiled and sold into concubinage, eventually resorting to begging and street prostitution. This work is a harrowing chronicle of the oppression of women, but Mizoguchi balances scathing social criticism with great formal beauty and a serene visual style. 35mm </p>
<p>November 3 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Sisters of the Gion</span> <br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1936 69 m </p>
<p>This film, set in Kyoto's Gion district, concerns a geisha who initiates her younger sister into the trade; the relationship between the two dramatizes the conflict between tradition and modernity. The older woman values loyalty to her patrons, while the younger one believes they should put their own interests first. But the sisters learn that whether they follow tradition or reject it, their lowly status as geishas and as women ensures that they share the same, tragic fate. Often considered the best Japanese film of the prewar era, it was the only Mizoguchi film to win Japan's top film prize, the Kinema Junpo award. 16mm </p>
<p>November 10 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Ugetsu </span><br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1953 96 m</p>
<p>This film will be introduced by Mizoguchi scholar Chika Kinoshita.  In war-torn 16th-century Japan, two peasants leave home seeking wealth and accomplishment. But in achieving his goals, each man brings tragedy to himself and his family. Based on a Japanese fairy tale and incorporating elements from the Noh theatrical tradition, this deeply poetic film illustrates the Zen principle of mono no ware, an acceptance of the inherent sadness of life and the transience of all things. (Mizoguchi converted to Buddhism shortly after making this film). <em>Ugetsu</em> is frequently cited as one of the masterpieces of world cinema. 35mm</p>
<p>November 17 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Sansho the Bailiff </span><br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1954 125 m </p>
<p>In this haunting tale of tyranny, sacrifice, and salvation set in 11th century Japan, a provincial governor is sent into exile, his wife is forced into prostitution, and his son and daughter are sold as slaves. Raised by the brutal tax collector Sansho, the son grows into a cruel and bitter man, until a memory from his past forces him to question what he has become. This magisterial, lovingly detailed film movingly illustrates the maxim, "without mercy, a man is not a man." The beautiful photography is by the great cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, who makes extensive use of Mizoguchi's characteristic long takes and deep-focus shots. 35mm </p>
<p> November 24 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Osaka Elegy</span> <br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1936 71m </p>
<p>A landmark in the development of realism in Japanese cinema, this powerful social protest film concerns a young telephone operator who becomes her boss' mistress in order to pay her father's debts. Gradually, she slips into a life of prostitution, and though she eventually becomes the sole support of her entire family, they reject her for what she has become. Osaka Elegy marked Mizoguchi's first collaboration with screenwriter Yoshikata Yoda, and, though he had been making films for 15 years, it was not until this film that he came into his own as director. He said, "I was able finally to learn to show life as I see it." 16mm </p><p>December 1 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Street of Shame</span> <br />
Kenji Mizoguchi, 1956 88m </p>
<p>In this, his final film, Mizoguchi abandoned his earlier lyricism for a harsher naturalism. At Dreamland, an ironically named Tokyo brothel, five women have turned to prostitution for economic survival in devastated postwar Japan. As a child, Mizoguchi saw his own sister sold to a geisha house, and in his films he demonstrated profound sympathy for geishas and prostitutes. It has been argued that this film&mdash;a portrait of their relationships, dreams, and frustrations&mdash; was influential in outlawing prostitution in Japan, which was banned there shortly after the film's release. 35mm </p>

<p>September 30 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Culloden/The Wargame</span> <br />
Peter Watkins, 1969/1965 72/42m </p>
<p>These two films represent the beginnings of the Mockumentary genre as well as amazing claims to truth. Culloden is a re-enactment of the legendary Scottish war between the Highland forces of Bonnie Prince Charles and the British army; much of this is, by necessity, fictional. The second film is a truer Mockumentary, and portrays the horror of a postnuclear war England. Though it was meant to air on the virtually censor-less BBC, it was considered too intense and violent to broadcast. Although fictional, the film actually won an Oscar for best Documentary. 16mm </p><p>October 7 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Fear of a Black Hat </span><br />
Rusty Cundieff, 1994 88m </p>
<p>What <em>Spinal Tap</em> did to Heavy Metal, <em>Fear of a Black Hat</em> does to the world of rap. NWH (Niggaz With Hats, as opposed to the real-life NWA, Niggaz With Attitude) must win over their fans, while still maintaining their image as angry young black men. The band's name comes from the invented idea that, in the days of slavery, field hands were forced to work in the sun without hats so that they would be too tired to revolt. Complete with parodies of every hit single of the era, this is a must for anyone interested in music. 35mm </p>

<p>October 14 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Zelig </span><br />
Woody Allen, 1983 79m </p>
<p>Comic genius Woody Allen brings a touch of class to the genre by getting talking heads like Susan Sontag and Saul Bellow to corroborate his story. Leonard Zelig (Allen), the quirky protagonist, is able to become the people who surround him. Among the obese, he gains tremendous amounts of weight; in Chinatown he begins speaking perfect Mandarin. Set in the roaring '20s, Allen uses innovative editing techniques to place himself alongside major luminaries of the time like Babe Ruth and Woodrow Wilson. 35mm </p><p>October 21 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Waiting for Guffman </span><br />
Christopher Guest, 1996 84m </p>
<p>Christopher Guest (<em>This is Spinal Tap</em>) is often credited with the popularization of the Mockumentary genre. In this off-beat comedy about the 150th anniversary of a small Missouri town, an off-off-off-Broadway director (writer/director Guest) produces a musical featuring a cast of the town's locals. The great ensemble cast is best at acting badly, from the dentist who yearns for stardom (Eugene Levy), to the DQ-employee (Parker Posey), to the All-American couple (Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard). 35mm </p>
<p>October 28 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Bob Roberts </span><br />
Tim Robbins, 1992 102m </p>
<p>If George W.'s down-home credibility came from being a folk-singer, he might look a lot like Bob Roberts (Robbins), a millionaire who runs for the US Senate. Making use of the entertainment culture of American politics, Roberts hides his corrupt campaign goals (gunsfor-drugs trades) behind a compassionate conservative veneer. Robbins blurs the line between real and fake through cameos by actors (Helen Hunt and Susan Sarandon) and experts (Gore Vidal) to create a film that's both funny and frightening. 35mm</p>

  <span class="title">Man Bites Dog </span><br />
R&eacute;my Belveaux, 1992 95m</p>
<p>Ben is a vicious serial killer which, in today's television world, makes him the perfect protagonist for a new series. A camera crew is hired to follow him around as he kills, steals, and waxes intellectually about the arts, literature, and life. In the end, he is so engaging that the crew itself is sucked into his morally mishmashed world. Though often graphically disturbing, the film's subtle humor and charm win over the real-life viewers as well; this film won the International Critic's Prize at Cannes. </p>

  <span class="title">Nothing So Strange</span> <br />
Brian Flemming, 2002 82m </p>
<p>This bizarre and rarely-seen film begins with the assassination of Bill Gates on December 2, 1999. As the requisite mourning period comes to a close, an independent group called Citizens for Truth launches an aggressive investigation into the killing, leading them into conflicts with the gratuitously mainstream press and the quasi-villainous LAPD. Using footage that imitates the Kennedy assassination and the genre of conspiracy theory that surrounded it, Flemming succeeds in a revolutionary blurring of the fictional world and the real one.

  <span class="title">Close-Up</span> <br />
Abbas Kiarostami, 1990 100m </p>
<p>Renowned Iranian director Kiarostami documents the trial of an unemployed film fanatic who has been arrested for impersonating the famous director Mohsen Makmalbaf and telling a stranger that he wants to make a documentary about her family. This improbable story is true, but, just as in the real-life case, it is unclear who are actors or actual participants. The tricked family remains at the center of a famous director's film, just not as they had envisioned. An ambiguous mix of dramatization and original footage. </p>

  <span class="title">The Beaver Trilogy</span> <br />
Trent Harris, 2001 83m </p>
<p>"Groovin" Gary is a young man from Beaver, Utah with a remarkable talent: dressed in a massive blonde wig and black leather, he does off-key renditions of Olivia Newton John's oeuvre. The first film is simply Trent Harris's 1979 documenting of Gary's story and his struggle with his conservative town. In the second film, made in 1981, a young Sean Penn does his own Groovin' Gary impersonation with some added narrative. The final film, from 1985, turns Gary (this time played by Crispin Glover) from a pathetic fool into a tragic hero. DVD </p>

  <span class="title">Stranger than Paradise </span><br />
Jim Jarmusch, 1983 89m </p>
<p>Jarmusch's second feature establishes his ambivalence to traditional modes of storytelling, which he later explained by saying: "Life has no plot, why must films or fiction?" A low-budget, rambling affair, this introduces us to a mood-driven filmmaking that's thin on story but delivers humor, character depth, and emotion with a gentle and grainy touch. John Lurie plays a drifter, Willie, who heads with his buddy Eddie on a road trip in order to find Willie's Hungarian cousin, Eva. b/w 35mm </p>
<p>October 7 9:15 <br />
  <span class="title">Down by Law</span> <br />
Jim Jarmusch, 1986 107m </p>
<p>Described by the filmmaker as a "neobeat-noir-comedy," it features Lurie again, now with famed hobo balladeer Tom Waits and Italian comic Roberto Benigni. Lurie and Waits are too laid back to avoid being framed for crimes, and the three meet up in and escape from a New Orleans jail. Their escape leads them through dense swamplands and perhaps denser humor. Robby M&uuml;ller's cinematography is gorgeous; the lush shots of Louisiana's wilderness look forward to Dead Man. b/w</p>

    <span class="title">Mystery Train </span><br />
  Jim Jarmusch, 1989 113m </p>
<p>This film begins with a Japanese couple that travels to Memphis; she likes Elvis, he likes Carl Perkins. Two more storylines emerge from chance encounters at the hotel the couple is staying at. As Jarmusch continues his comic view of America through the eyes of outsiders, he extends his experiments with narrative, inviting us to make connections between characters, stories, and locations. The nice thing is that the connections are neither forced nor profound. Beautiful cinematography by M&uuml;ller, but this time in color. 35mm</p>

  <span class="title">Night on Earth </span><br />
Jim Jarmusch, 1991 129m </p>
<p>Five cabbies in five cities, and their conversations with passengers. We see a number of the Jarmusch regulars return, from actors (Roberto Benigni and Tom Waits) to stylistic preferences (multiple stories, emphasis on character studies). The stories occur in roughly sequential moments of time, including Winona Ryder and Gena Rowlands discussing&mdash;what else&mdash;movies in L.A. Jarmusch pushes narrative logic to the extreme by means of a loosely sequential temporal flow. 16mm </p><p>October 28 9:30 <br />
  <span class="title">Dead Man</span> <br />
Jim Jarmusch, 1995 121m </p>
<p>A brilliant revision of the Western, this film is not to be missed on the big screen. With a humming, coughing, and soaring musical score by Neil Young, this is Jarmusch at his best. Johnny Depp plays William Blake, an accountant from Ohio who travels out West and becomes a killer and, perhaps, a visionary poet. Witty and strange, like other Jarmusch films, this one has a stronger sense of purpose behind its loose narrative, emerging as a commentary on the American wilderness and our place within it. b/w 35mm </p>

  <span class="title">Amateur </span> <br />
Hal Hartley, 1994 104m </p>
<p>By the time Hartley's fifth feature came out, he had already forged a cult following for his offbeat art films. Loaded with black humor, metaphysical ponderings, and bizarre storylines, his films also had distinctive visual style, with overdetermined colors and stylized compositions. Amateur is more accessible than his earlier work but no less strange. A man wakes up bloodied with no memory; an ex-nun and aspiring pornographer helps him as he tries to piece together his identity. 16mm </p><p>November 11 9:00 <br />
  <span class="title">The Book of Life </span><br />
Hal Hartley, 1998 63m </p>
<p>This comedy about the second coming of Christ was made during the shooting of Henry Fool. Jesus shows up in New York on the last day of the century to perform the Last Judgment and initiate the end of the world, but he's having second thoughts. This film is part of the French "Collection 2000 Seen By" television series of films about the millenium. With P. J. Harvey as Jesus's assistant, Magdalena, and Thomas Jay Ryan as Satan. </p>

  <span class="title">Henry Fool</span> <br />
Hal Hartley, 1997 137m </p>
<p>This film marks a shift in Hartley's style, as he jettisons stark colors, flat walls, and aloof characters for warm, textured images and flesh and bone characters. In this loose fable about art and society, Henry is a rebellious drifter, an intellectual ego-maniac, and an ex-convict boozer who moves into Simon's basement. Simon's a garbage man who already has his depressed mother and over-sexed sister to deal with. While Henry labors on his masterwork, Simon manages to publish a work that brings him both fame and scandal. </p>

  <span class="title">No Such Thing</span> <br />
Hal Hartley, 2002 105m </p>
<p>A foul-mouthed Monster, disgusted with human evolution and the vagaries of consumer society, has taken to killing anyone who crosses his path (which happens to be in Iceland). He is impervious to nuclear radiation, he's indestructible, and it's unclear that he'll ever be gotten rid of. A journalist for a sensationalistic TV news program forges a relationship with him that develops as the film builds its fable about the negative effects of a shallow media. An updated "Beauty and the Beast," but through Hartley's idiosyncratic and stylish lens. 35mm</p>

  <span class="title">Super Size Me </span><br />
Morgan Spurlock, 2004 96m </p>
<p>Setting out to prove the evils of the American fast food industry, Morgan Spurlock personally assumes the serious health risks of a lifestyle that is all-too quickly becoming the American way: little exercise and lots of French fries. The rules are simple: for 30 days Spurlock can consume only food and drink offered on the McDonalds menu, he has to consume three squares a day, and he must supersize his meal if offered. Spurlock makes a convincing case for passing on a big Mac. His unnerving physical and emotional breakdown is accompanied by a fascinating examination of politics, consumerism, and education in the fast food industry. 35mm </p><p>October 2 6:30, 9:00, 11:30 <br />
  <span class="title">Saved! </span><br />
Brian Dannelly, 2004 92m </p>
<p>Mary, a student at a fundamentalist Christian high school, sleeps with her gay boyfriend hoping to help Jesus change him. She ends up pregnant and questioning her church; her boyfriend is sent to a "degayification" center. The school's social/spiritual leader, holier-than-thou Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore) turns against Mary as she falls in with the school's misfits. The movie is filled with hilarious satire of the overly-pious, and though it isn't as biting as one might hope, when it all culminates at a prom where everyone gets exactly what they deserve, and even the gay kid finds a real date, it's easy to forgive this gratifyingly-sweet comedy for a little conventionality. 35mm </p>

  <span class="title">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind </span><br />
Michel Gondry, 2004 108m </p>
<p>Breaking up is still hard to do in the world of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich), but erasing all the painful memories is cake, thanks to a new procedure. After Clementine (Kate Winslet) has him erased, Joel (a restrained Jim Carrey) jealously signs up for a clean slate. The drama unfolds inside Joel's head as an untimely change of heart leaves him struggling to rescue Clementine's memory. Meanwhile, Elijah Wood as a lecherous technician pillages Joel's past for ways to win her over. If e'er you've longed for Kirsten Dunst to quote Nietzsche, this is the flick for you. 35mm </p>

  <span class="title">Coffee and Cigarettes</span> <br />
Jim Jarmusch, 2003 95m </p>
<p>Jarmusch's delightful and distinctive series of vignettes celebrates the gentle, joyous, and furious musings shared over the most commonplace of addictions. Composed of 11 comic shorts, the film has beautiful black and white cinematography and a wonderfully eccentric cast (including, but not limited to, Iggy Pop, Roberto Benigni, Bill Murray, and rappers Rza and Gza). In this endearingly oddball and hilarious collection, which was a full 17 years in the making, Jarmusch isolates the contemporary ritual of enjoying a cigarette, a cup of coffee, and the lighthearted, obsessive, and fantastic conversations that accompany them. 35mm </p>

  <span class="title">Story of the Weeping</span> <br />
Camel B. Davaa &amp; L. Falorni 90m </p>
<p>In the tradition of the great documentarian Robert Flaherty (Nanook of the North), this gem of a movie paints a vivid portrait of the nomadic shepherds of Mongolia living under the harshest conditions in the Gobi Desert. The filmmakers focus on the birth of a white camel calf that is rejected by its mother, using it as a catalyst for examining the traditional tribal life. A musician brought to mend the rift between mother and young with a soothing song could have been played for cheap suspense but the earnest appeal for our patience provides ample rewards, especially for the little ones. 35mm </p>

Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, 2004 141m</p>
<p> It's another year at Hogwarts and Harry Potter finds that he may be in mortal danger once again. This time, the man accused of his parents' murder has escaped from Azkaban prison and is reportedly searching for him. Even worse, the school is under quarantine with grim-reaper-like guards from Azkaban lurking, ready to steal the life force out of any unsuspecting students. What's a prodigious young wizard to do? In this third installment of the series, director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Y Tu Mama Tambien) puts forth a darker and more serious vision that audiences, both young and old, will enjoy. 35mm </p>

Jehane Noujaim, 2004 84m </p>
<p>Condemned by American officials as "Osama bin Laden's mouthpiece," AlJazeera is the Arab world's first independent news channel. In her chronicle of Al-Jazeera's Iraq war coverage, Noujaim examines the process by which news is gathered and constructed, questioning the meaning of objectivity in American media as well. She focuses on a few intriguing characters, particularly the open-minded American press officer, Lt. Rushing; an idealistic Sudanese journalist, Hassan Ibrahim; and an highly unpredictable Iraqi producer, Samir Khader. This timely documentary on the meaning of truth and propaganda avoids absolute conclusions. 35mm </p><p>October 23 6:15, 9:00, 11:45 <br />

Quentin Tarantino, 2004 136m </p>
<p>Hearts explode for various reasons as The Bride continues her "roaring rampage of revenge" against her old flame and former mentor, the titular Bill. After the first installment's bloody climax, Tarantino sets himself the unlikely task of resensitizing us to violence&mdash;but not so much that we don't recognize Shogun Assassin as the perfect bedtime story or yearn to see the screen explode with tomato-red splendor when Ennio Morricone's Western melodies hit us with nostalgia. Despite an endless stream of film-geek allusions (including the return of Gordon Liu), an encyclopedic knowledge of pulp is not required to take in the oddly-touching conclusion. 35mm </p>

Mich&#230;l Moore, 2004 122m </p>
<p>Mich&#230;l Moore is at it again. <em>Fahrenheit 9/11</em> has already broken barriers. It was the first documentary since 1956 to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes. It became the highest grossing documentary of all-time in a single weekend. But can it break the Bush Administration? Moore sure hopes so. The documentary contains little new argumentation, but it skillfully collects all the data points in one place. There's the President's military record, the Patriot Act, the Iraq war, the 2000 ballot debacle, the intelligence scandals, and so much Moore. Regardless of whether it makes you cheer or jeer, <em>Fahrenheit 9/11</em> is an undeniably important film this election year. 35mm </p>

Mario Van Peebles, 2003 108m </p>
<p>In this touching and invigorating tribute to the godfather of blaxploitation cinema, Mario Van Peebles chronicles the events leading up to the making of his father's trailblazing Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song and its success as the top independent grosser of 1971. In moments of distraught violence and painful exercise, the movie reveals a man tailored in a corporate studio system but forced to adopt the life of a renegade filmmaker and father to realize a personal statement against a history of racist and oppressive images of blacks. Dizzy with insubordination and humor, this is a movie for those who embrace the ruffled edges and survival tactics of the indie movement. 35mm </p>

Wolfgang Becker, 2003 121m </p>
<p>Alex isn't happy living in socialist East Germany, but things get worse when after spotting him at a protest, his mother has a heart attack and goes into a coma. As she sleeps, the Berlin Wall falls and capitalism spreads. When she wakes, Alex reconstructs East Germany in her bedroom, worrying that the shock of learning that the Iron Curtain is no more could overwhelm her fragile heart. He pays children to sing old anthems, fabricates news reels, and roots through trash in search of East German wrappers to mask his new Western tastes. The movie is a great comedy, but its real magic is in its nuanced treatment of change, both personal and governmental. 35mm </p>

<p>Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is proud owner of a run-down gym called Average Joe's. When he defaults on bill payments, Average Joe's becomes the target of a hostile corporate takeover by the monolith Globo Gym Inc. headed by the brash and obnoxious White Goodman, played by Ben Stiller. Peter's only hope is to assemble a ragtag team of misfits to win the cash prize at a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas. With a cameo from Lance Armstrong, <em>Dodgeball</em> will certainly delight fans of <em>Zoolander</em>, <em>Meet the Parents</em>, and <em>Starsky and Hutch</em>. Plus, it will motivate you to get to the gym. 35mm</p>

  <span class="title">Before Sunset </span><br />
Richard Linklater, 2004 80m </p>
<p>A follow-up to the auteur's 1995 cult classic Before Sunrise, this film catches up with Jesse and Celine nine years after their fateful meeting on a train to Vienna that ended with an existential cliffhanger totally befitting Gen-X crisis: Will they reconvene with their romance six months later? Or haplessly let it pass to base a potential New York Times best-seller? Thankfully these questions are answered as the pair finds each other's company again, this time in Paris. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy cowrote the screenplay and the result pays off with their long, spiritual conversations perfectly attuned to the insights and longings of people removed from youth. 35mm </p>
<p>November 13 6:00, 9:30 <br />
  <span class="title">Dogville </span><br />
Lars von Trier, 2003 177m </p>
<p>Arguably the movie that brought cinema to its knees during a year crowded by pointless retreads, this is a true polemical treatise and religious parable that registers on an artistic level. Nicole Kidman, more ethereal than ever, plays a moral fugitive on the run from gangsters and gangbusters alike, seeking shelter and acceptance in <em>Dogville</em>. What unfolds may appear to be a stubborn Marxist deconstruction of capitalist ethics, but upon closer inspection, the story resonates beyond the chalk outlines marked across its stage to the measureless gift of human charity so evident in its finale. The first of an ongoing trilogy called <em>USA&mdash;Land of Opportunities</em>. 35mm </p><p>November 19 7:00. 9:00, 11:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle</span> <br />
Danny Leiner, 2004 88m </p>
<p>With a slight twist on the stoner comedy's "white guys talking about getting laid" formula, Leiner makes something much funnier than his last film, Dude, Where's My Car?. Harold ("that Chinese guy from American Pie") and Kumar ("that Indian guy from Van Wilder") are roommates with one thing on their minds. And it isn't what you think. Well, they also have that on their minds, but it's secondary to the supreme goal: eating at White Castle. On the way, they get chased by a cheetah, perform surgery, get their car stolen by Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser), and even have a little of that other thing on their minds. 35mm </p><p>November 20 6:15, 9:00, 11:45 <br />

Let sit until delusions, recurring nightmares, and Shaw's political career begin to form. Extract one Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington), Leader of the Army Unit. Nominate Shaw for Vice Presidency. Watch Major Marco unravel the truth about Shaw. Mix in one Sergeant's mother (Meryl Streep). Connect to multinational corporation Manchurian Global. Bake for about two hours.

Zach Braff, 2004 109m </p>
<p>Andrew Largeman shuffles numbly through life, scraping by as a part-time actor and part-time waiter in a full-time lithium coma. His mother's sudden death forces him to journey "home" to Jersey. As Largeman (Scrubs star Zach Braff, in his screen-writing and directing debut) evades contact with his estranged father, he begins to wake from his medicated sleepwalk. He shifts through hometown acquaintances and stumbles upon a kindred spirit, Sam (Natalie Portman). With Sam's unexpected comfort and affection, Largeman pioneers the beauty and pain of an unmuted life. Sweetly offbeat, genuinely humorous, and, at times, quietly philosophic. 35mm </p><p>November 27 6:15, 9:00, 11:45 <br />
  <span class="title">Spiderman 2 </span><br />
Sam Raimi, 2004 127m </p>
<p>Years after his radioactive spider-bite, Peter Parker finds himself struggling to balance web-slinging with his job, his studies, and his deteriorating personal life. Torn between his heroic duties and his lifelong crush Mary Jane, Spidey calls it quits just as (yet another) freak lab accident transforms scientist Otto Octavious into the tentacled terror Dr. Octopus. An awesome CGI-enhanced fights ensue. Cameos by Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell, the director's long-suffering car, and comics legend Stan Lee. Against all expectations, chain-saw king Sam Raimi (<em>Evil Dead</em>) has perhaps shot the most charmingly unironic superhero flick ever made. 35mm</p>

  <span class="title">Maria Full of Grace</span> <br />
Joshua Marston, 2004 101m </p>
<p>Both a harrowing coming of age story and a probing look at a disturbingly pervasive phenomenon, <em>Maria Full of Grace</em> follows the story of a young Colombian woman drawn into the underground world of drug trafficking. Tired of being mistreated at a local factory, the strongwilled Maria leaves her job and agrees to act as a "mule." Risking prison and even her life, she swallows dozens of heroin pellets in exchange for hundreds of dollars and ticket to New York. In a stunning debut performance, Catalina Sandino Moreno perfectly captures the heartbreaking dilemma of a girl driven to desperation. 35mm </p><p>December 4 7:00, 9:00, 11:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Napoleon Dynamite</span> <br />
Jared Hess, 2004 82m </p>
<p>It is hard to pin down what's appealing about a troubled teen named Napoleon Dynamite. He is pessimistic and socially inept to the extreme; he stores spare potato puffs in his pockets; and, for all his talk, he doesn't seem to have any real talents. But, for whatever reason, he has made audiences at Sundance and just about everywhere else laugh out loud. The movie follows good ole Napo as he gets rejected by the popular girl, argues with his loser brother, and finally makes a friend. Perhaps no one appreciates this film like an Idahoan, but anyone who has ever lived in, been to, or made fun of small-town America will understand the humor in this satire. 35mm </p>

<p>October 3 7:00 <br />
    <span class="title">Way Down East </span><br />
  D. W. Griffith, 1920 149m </p>
<p>This film, adapted from a Victorian stage melodrama, has a <em>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</em>-type plot: an innocent waif from the country (Lillian Gish) is seduced and abandoned by a cad from the city. The story may be familiar, but Griffith infuses it with such emotional directness and storytelling flair that it transcends its genre. The result is one of Griffith's greatest works, second only to <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> in popularity. Gish's incandescent performance, the vivid on-location photography, and a spectacular finale on the ice floes help make this film an emotionally overwhelmingly experience. 16mm </p>

<p>October 10 7:00 <br />
  <span class="title">Camille </span><br />
George Cukor, 1936 109m </p>
<p>Based on a Dumas novel (also the source for Verdi's <em>La Traviata</em>), this is the classic hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold story, focusing on the doomed romance between a consumptive, self-sacrificing prostitute (Greta Garbo, in one of her finest performances) and a handsome young nobleman (Robert Taylor). It is frequently cited as one of Hollywood's greatest romantic movies. Garbo was never more beautiful, and her warm and delicately ironic performance is quietly heartbreaking. The lavish MGM production is an exquisite
 evocation of the 19th century Parisian demimonde. 35mm </p>

  <span class="title">Stella Dallas</span> <br />
 King Vidor, 1937 106m </p>
<p>In perhaps the ultimate maternal self sacrifice film, Barbara Stanwyck gives one of her greatest performances. Her <em>Stella</em> is a loud, vulgar, clownishly dressed party girl on the outside, but deeply caring on the inside. When she realizes that she's becoming an embarrassment, she gives her beloved only child (Anne Shirley) up to her socially prominent ex-husband. Vidor handles the material with great sensitivity and power, and Stanwyck is vivid and remarkably emotionally honest. Her unforgettable final close-up has perhaps the highest tear-jerking quotient of any scene in this series. 35mm </p>

  <span class="title">History is Made at Night </span><br />
Frank Borzage, 1937 97m </p>
<p>Fleeing her sadistic, jealous ex-husband, Jean Arthur is swept off her feet by charming Parisian headwaiter Charles Boyer. But the couple's happiness is threatened by Arthur's ex, who is determined to tear them apart. Thanks to Arthur and Boyer's marvelous chemistry, this underrated gem is a highly unusual mix of comedy, romance, and intense melodrama. The film gains depth with Borzage's trademark romanticism, especially during the thrilling, Titanic-like shipboard climax. The elegant photography is by the great cinematographer Gregg Toland (<em>Citizen Kane</em>). 16mm </p>

<p>As a screen couple, Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are best known for their inspired screwball teamwork in <em>The Awful Truth</em> and <em>My Favorite Wife</em>. But they were also remarkably effective in this tear-jerker, which tells the bittersweet story of the travails of a married couple over the years. Grant gives a touching, beautifully controlled performance here; it's probably the finest acting he ever did in a "serious" role. Stevens (Shane) directs in a style that is both understated and emotionally affecting. In the role of a family friend, Edgar Buchanan provides welcome comic relief. 16mm </p>

  <span class="title">Now, Voyager </span><br />
Irving Rapper, 1942 117m </p>
<p>Arguably the most entertaining movie ever made. In one of her most compelling performances, Bette Davis plays Charlotte Vale, a dowdy, neurotic spinster who, after a nervous breakdown, enlists the help of a kindly shrink (Claude Rains). Psychoanalysis transforms her; having discovered contact lenses, eyebrow tweezers, and great hats, the slimmed down Charlotte goes on a cruise. There, she meets a handsome architect (the impossibly suave Paul Henreid). Among this film's many glories are the swooning Max Steiner score and the giddily romantic dialogue. Archival print. 35mm </p>

  <span class="title">Mildred Pierce </span><br />
Mich&#230;l Curtiz, 1945 111m </p>
<p>Tear-jerker meets film noir in this film, based on a novel by James M. Cain. Joan Crawford stars as a woman who claws her way from roadhouse waitress to successful entrepreneur, all in the name of her beloved daughter Veda (Ann Blyth). This film was a personal triumph for Crawford; after suffering the humiliation of being fired by MGM, she won the Oscar for this role. But it's Eve Arden, as Crawford's wisecracking best friend, who steals the picture. Arden says of Blyth: "Personally, Veda's got me convinced that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young." 35mm </p>

  <span class="title">Letter from an Unknown Woman</span> <br />
Max Oph&uuml;ls, 1948 86m</p>
<p> In turn-of-the-century Vienna, Joan Fontaine is a young woman seduced and promptly abandoned by concert pianist Louis Jourdan. But though he may have forgotten her, she remains hopelessly in love. Then, years later, they meet again... This lush, hauntingly romantic film is probably the finest American effort by the great German director Max Oph&uuml;ls (The Earrings of Madame de...); the lyrical, gliding camera movements and long tracking shots beautifully convey a world of feeling. Based on a novel by Stefan Zweig and adapted by Howard Koch, of Casablanca fame. 35mm</p>

  <span class="title">All That Heaven Allows</span> <br />
Douglas Sirk, 1955 89m </p>
<p>Director Douglas Sirk has beeen an important influence on filmmakers ranging 
from Fassbinder and Alomovodar to Todd Haynes and John Waters. Despite his 
background in German avant-garde theater, Sirk is best known for his glossy 
yet subversive Hollywood melodramas. This work, one of his best, concerns a 
wealthy widow (Jane Wyman, Ronald Reagan's ex) whose love affair with her 
hunky gardener (Rock Hudson) causes social and family disapproval. This highly 
stylized yet sentimental film offers a searing critique of small-town 
provinciality and mid-century American materialism. 16mm</p>
