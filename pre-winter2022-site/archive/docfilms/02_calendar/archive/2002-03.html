Jules Dassin's masterpiece (for which he won Best director at Cannes) follows Tony le Stephanois as he is released from jail and joins a group of thieves planning to knock over a jewelry store.

Maurice Pialat, 1980	110m
<p>A wealthy businesswoman (Isabelle Huppert) leaves her life of comfort and safety to shack up with a working class brute (Gerard Depardieu) in this cruel, brash film of fits and starts.  Full of fear and exhilaration, the two lovers collaborate with a gang of thieves. The film focuses on the most ordinary of effects: an empty  street after an evening at the bar and the tautness of sheets on a newly made bed.  There is no heavy-handed psychology, no morality, and no inevitability; only drunken stumbling down blind alleys toward broken bedframes.	35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

July 11	8:00
<br /><span class="title">I Am Cuba</span><br />
Mikhail Kalatozov, 1964	141m
<p>Once Khrushchev's and Castros' glorification of the Cuban revolution and a poetic and cinematic piece, I Am Cuba defies comparison. Four stories present the situation in Cuba before the revolution. Two poets collaborated on the screenplay, and the film maintains a lyrical feeling throughout.

Roman Polanski, 1974	131m

Robert Towne's Oscar-winning screenplay, with its intricate twists and witty dialogue, honors the motifs of film noir while simultaneously shattering them.

Henry Koster, 1950	104m
<p>Elwood P. Dowd (Jimmy Stewart) is an affable, absent-minded man who lives with his sister Vita but much prefers the company of Harvey, a six foot three and three quarter inch tall white rabbit—a pooka to be exact.

The doctors are taken by Elwood's charm. In the end the doctors, and even Vita, must admit to seeing Harvey. 35mm

July 26	7:00, 9:30

John Woo, 1990	110m
<p>Starring veteran bad-ass Chow Yun-Fat (The Corruptor), The Killer tells the story of an assassin who becomes obsessed with a woman he accidentally blinded, and the intricate relationship he develops with the cop who pursues him. A predecessor of both Face/Off and Heat, this is the cross-over action movie of the 1990s. Director John Woo (Face/Off), presents us with a ferocious ballet as he gives us beautifully choreographed shots of violence in Hong Kong.  		35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

July 27	7:00, 9:30
<br /><span class="title">Zero Effect</span><br />
Jake Kasdan, 1998	115m
<p>In this hilarious detective's tale, a paranoid genius, Daryl Zero (Bill Pullman) is a recluse who tortures his sharp assistant (Ben Stiller) with his god-awful music and lifestyle. His new case, however, leads him to an unexpectedly worthy opponent: love. As the self-declared “world's greatest detective”, Pullman delivers a convincingly neurotic performance as the ever-quirky Zero. Kasdan's refreshing and ingenious script makes this film a must-see; Pullman and Stiller are at their absolute best.		35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

July 31	8:00
<br /><span class="title">Arsenic and Old Lace</span><br />
Frank Capra, 1944	118m
<p>Mortimer Bruster (Cary Grant) puts his honeymoon on hold when he becomes entangled in his aunts' unique hobby: poisoning lonely old men and burying them in the basement. Bruster tries to save his aunts by placing the blame on an insane cousin who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt and digs graves in the basement for yellow fever victims working on the Panama Canal.  Arsenic is a slapstick comedy that brings dealing with crazy family members to a new level.	35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

August 1	8:00
<br /><span class="title">My Fair Lady</span><br />
George Cukor, 1964	170m
<p>This is the classic remake of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (later remade into She's All That).  A bet between two men leads Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), an arrogant linguistic professor, to remake a woman into someone more attractive, leading in the end to true love. Yet, instead of the dorky, pretty/ugly girl in She's All That, the woman is Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), a commoner. My Fair Lady is one of the greatest musicals of all time.		35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

August 2	7:00, 9:30
<br /><span class="title">The Maltese Falcon</span><br />
John Huston, 1941	101m

Spade encounters others who are also in search of the valuable bird. In addition to ushering in the film noir genre and iconizing Bogart, The Maltese Falcon debuts a number of formidable film talents, including director John Huston and Sydney Greenstreet, who was nominated as best supporting actor for his role.	35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

August 3	7:00, 9:45
<br /><span class="title">L.A. Confidential</span><br />
Curtis Hanson, 1997	136m
<p>This glamorous adaptation of James Ellroy's monster novel was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. An all-star cast, including Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and Kim Basinger, turns in a perfect performance in this intense but polished film that oozes with style. L.A. Confidential is a tale of police corruption and the Hollywood that supports it; but, of course, this is all off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush!	35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

August 7	8:00
<br /><span class="title">I'll Never Cry</span><br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />

August 9	7:00, 9:45
<br /><span class="title">The Sting</span><br />
George Roy Hill, 1973	129m

<p>&nbsp;<br />

August 15	8:00
<br /><span class="title">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</span><br />
Sergio Leone, 1967	161m
<p>This spaghetti western made Clint Eastwood an icon as “The Man With No Name”, a gunslinger with a desert-warped sense of honor. Crossing the American West during the Civil War, he and a partner encounter a group of dead and dying Confederate soldiers, one of whom discloses the location of buried gold. Ennio Morricone's legendary musical theme underscores Leone's classic widescreen portrayal of human brutality playing itself out amidst stunning beauty. 35mm

Alfred Hitchcock, 1946	101m

Sally Potter, 1993	92m
<p>Inspired by Virginia Woolf's novel, this is the story of a man named Orlando who has eternal youth, and lives through four centuries of experiences, even becoming a woman. The film challenges convention as the gifted Tilda Swinton (The Deep End) plays Orlando, while Queen Elizabeth is played by Quentin Crisp. Under the graceful and elegant direction of Sally Potter, Orlando is a beautiful film that examines the very meaning of human existence. 		35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

Blake Edwards, 1961	115m

Fred (George Peppard) meets Holly, leading to a series of attempts to get her to stop courting Brazilian coffee magnates and French bachelor dukes.  Based on the Truman Capote novel, the classic romance story even stars the not-very-convincingly Japanese, but still comedic Mickey Rooney.  With a name like “Holly Golightly”, it's got to be good.	35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<br /><span class="title">Faust</span><br />
Jan Svankmajer, 1994	   97m

The journey is a mix of observational participation, with references to Marlow's Doctor Faustus and Kafka. 	35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />

August 24	7:00, 9:30
<br /><span class="title">The Last Seduction</span><br />

Christopher Nolan, 1999	70m
<p>Following focuses on a young man who is obsessed with following strangers to learn about them. When he meets Cobb, his intriguing foil, he descends into a dark underworld that ends in a triple-cross. Time shifts, Nolan's beloved trick, give this elaborate plot a depth of mystery and uncertainty, adding to the film's noir feel. This is Christopher Nolan's directorial debut, before he went on to direct the popular Memento and now Insomnia. He does not disappoint. 35mm
<p>&nbsp;<br />

August 31	7:00, 9:30
<br /><span class="title">The Conversation</span><br />
Francis Ford Coppola, 1974	113m
