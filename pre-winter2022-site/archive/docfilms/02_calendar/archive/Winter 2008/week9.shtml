<H2>Calendar: Week 9</H2>

<H3>March 2 - March 8</H3>


Sunday, March 2 - 1:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">La vie en rose</STRONG><BR>
<I>Oliver Dahan, 2007 - 140 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">Edith Piaf, the most singular crooner of the twentieth century, famously sang, 'Non, je ne regrette rien.' But her life was dotted with many events that a less stoic woman would have readily regretted. This biopic trudges through it all - the brothels, the blindness, the morphine, the brutes. Sounds harsh, but Marion Cotillard's note-perfect impersonation of Piaf is something to see. She'll probably have earned an Oscar for this performance by the time you read this - and, indeed, she makes misery such a joy to behold. <I>35mm.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

Sunday, March 2 - 4:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Darjeeling Limited</STRONG><BR>
<I>Wes Anderson, 2007 - 91 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">Wes Anderson's new comedy finds him as whimsical and heartfelt as ever in its tale of three estranged siblings' journey across India in an attempt to get over their father's death. While the film is full of pathos, comic misadventures remain prominent: the three endure an illegal cobra purchase, romantic intrigue with a pretty train attendant, and innumerable skirmishes in which familial resentments boil over in Anderson's singularly farcical manner. Featuring cameos by Angelica Huston and Bill Murray, Darjeeling Limited is a fine addition to the Anderson canon. <I>35mm.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>


Sunday, March 2 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">So This is Paris</STRONG><BR> 
<I>Ernst Lubitsch, 1926 - 80 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">Lubitsch finished his streak of silent sex farces in high style with <I>So This is Paris</I>. Unlike the others, <I>So This is Paris</I> is drawn from contemporary fashion, taking swipes at the Charleston and Valentino fans. Two unhappily married couples (Dr. and Mrs. Paul Giraud; dancers Maurice and Georgette Lalle) discover one another and contemplate affairs. Each party must 
maintain appearances or shift suspicions elsewhere through concocted identities, fantastic stories, or convenient detentions. While affections and intentions remain reasonably concealed, the phallic dimensions of Dr. Giraud's thrashing cane do not. <I>16mm.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>


Monday, March 3 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Naked Kiss</STRONG><BR> 
<I>Sam Fuller, 1964 - 90 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray"><I>Candy's Place - where all kinds of men find all kinds of sweets!</I><BR>
A classic pulp spectacle, <I>The Naked Kiss</I> features the most lurid and indelible opening scene 
in Sam Fuller's oeuvre: when bald prostitute Kelly (Constance Towers) beats her pimp with a handbag, we know we're in for a wild ride. "I wanted to grab the audience like a screaming headline, and quickly establish the character of my lead, Kelly, in the first scene." After fleeing her prostitute lifestyle, Kelly seeks redemption in the small town of Granstville. There however, she finds more than she bargained for. <I>35mm.</I><BR>

Tuesday, March 4 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Trafic</STRONG><BR> 
<I>Jacques Tati, 1971 - 96 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">Monsieur Hulot makes his final appearance in this underseen film, where he attempts to drive a prototype car from Paris to an auto show in Amsterdam. Tati again masterfully blends satire with perfectly choreographed slapstick gags in his critique of our car-obsessed culture. Designed to be more accessible than <I>Playtime</I> in order to rescue Tati financially, <I>Trafic</I> still failed to find an audience. Yet despite the cynicism about the madness of the modern world and despite Tati's personal misfortunes, to the end, Monsieur Hulot remains undeterred, optimistic, and charming as ever. <I>In French; subtitled. 35mm.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, March 5 - 7:00, 9:15 
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Live Flesh</STRONG><BR>
<I>Pedro Almodóvar, 1997 - 103 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">This noirish adaptation of a Ruth Rendell novel about love, crime, and obsession has much more of a historical and political subtext than any of his other films. The riveting opening sequence involves a poor woman (Penelope Cruz) in Franco-era Spain giving birth on a city bus. The film then flashes forward 20 years, and centers on the complicated life and sexual relationships of Victor, a young man who goes to jail after accidentally shooting and paralyzing a cop (Javier Bardem). Almodóvar does full justice to Rendell's sexy, sophisticated, brilliantly plotted novel. <I>In Spanish; subtitled. 35mm.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>


Thursday, March 6 - 7:00 
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Murder By Contract</STRONG><BR> 
<I>Irving Lerner, 1958 - 81 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">Claude (Vince Edwards) decides to abandon his mundane life in order to become a well-paid contract killer. He pursues his new profession with "business is business" detachment, until he's assigned to assassinate a woman set to testify against a mob boss. The film's combination of dialogue, character acting, and a simple guitar score render it possibly the best hired gun movie ever. It's credited as a direct inspiration for Jim Jarmusch's <I>Ghost Dog</I>, as well as for the films <I>Mean Streets</I> and <I>Taxi Driver</I> by Martin Scorsese, who's said: "This is the film that has influenced me the most." <I>35mm.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>


Thursday, March 6 - 9:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Behind the Green Door</STRONG><BR> 
<I>Jim and Artie Mitchell, 1972 - 71 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">With the success of <I>Deep Throat</I> in 1972, pornographic films attained quasi-mainstream visibility. Suddenly it was chic to see pornographic films with semi-artistic, plot-driven pretensions like <I>The Devil in Miss Jones</I> and Behind the Green Door. For the latter, porn brothers Jim and Artie Mitchell recruited Marilyn Chambers – so all-American she 
was featured on boxes of Ivory soap – to star as a girl abducted into a sexual netherworld populated by kinky nuns, Oakland Raiders players, and trapeze artists. Seen in the rare 
Canadian version! <I>35mm.</I><BR>
<I>Introduced by sexploitation expert Joe Rubin.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>


Friday, March 7 - 6:30, 9:00, 11:30
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Control</STRONG><BR>
<I>Anton Corbijin, 2007 - 121 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">In the late 70s, English band Joy Division burst onto the music scene. The group, led by enigmatic lead singer Ian Curtis, became an enormous success. However, on the eve of their American tour and the height of their fame, Curtis committed suicide, abandoning his mistress, his wife and child, and his music career. The mystique of Ian Curtis surrounds the music of Joy Division to this day. Director Anton Corbijn attempts to strip Curtis' story of the hagiography and myth-building of other rock biopics, filling his debut film with stunning black-and-white photography. <I>35mm.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

Saturday, March 8 - 6:30, 9:00, 11:30
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Michael Clayton</STRONG><BR>
<I>Tony Gilroy, 2007 - 119 min.</I>
<DIV class="gray">If the tagline of Gilroy's movie - "The Truth Can Be Adjusted" - has a ring of "The Conspiracy is Global" and "Everything is Connected," that's because <I>Michael Clayton</I> is a worthy political thriller in the mold of <I>The Constant Gardener</I> and <I>Syriana</I>. This one is a little quieter, but no less scalding: George Clooney plays a 'fixer' for a powerful law firm in the midst of untangling an Enron-like corporate scandal. Clayton glimpses the madness at the core of corporate culture while repairing damage done by an unhinged partner and sparring with a brash counsel (Tilda Swinton). <I>35mm.</I></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
