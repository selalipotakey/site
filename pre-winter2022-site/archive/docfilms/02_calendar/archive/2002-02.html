<br /><span class="title"><a name="jordanklahr"></a>Jordan/Klahr</span>



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Two films by masters of cut-out animation! Larry Jordan's The Rime of

the Ancient Mariner (1977) puts the great French illustrator Gustave Doré's

1875 engravings of the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem into motion, with narration

performed by Orson Welles. Lewis Klahr, who cites Larry Jordan and Harry Smith

as important influences, has been deemed the reigning king of "cut and paste"

by critic J. Hoberman. Klahr's epic The Pharaoh's Belt (1993) uses magazine ads

from the 1950s and 60s to create worlds from which characters must, as Tom

Gunning writes, "negotiate a labor of extrication from the morass of Betty

Crocker chocolate icing." runs 85m&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="sonbertdorsky"></a>Sonbert/Dorsky</span>



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Carriage Trade (1971), the longest film in Warren Sonbert's oeuvre, is a

heavily edited silent barrage of imagery in which no shot lasts much more than

ten seconds. The 300+ shots, taken from Sonbert's travels through over a dozen

countries, depict famous tourist sites and the mundane activities that surround

them. Sonbert's Friendly Witness (1989), his first sound film in 20 years,

continues his "polyvalent montage" style, but with an added layer: rock music.

Nathaniel Dorsky uses a slower-paced montage in his film Hours for Jerome

(1980-82), which Sonbert has written "is simply the most beautifully

photographed film that I've ever seen."&nbsp; runs 128m&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="stanbrakhage"></a>Stan Brakhage</span>



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Stan Brakhage has been a powerful force in avant-garde filmmaking for

half a century. Since 1952, he has made almost 300 films with running times

that vary from under three minutes to over three hours. Tonight's program

offers a chance to see some of the films that earned Brakhage his comparison to

Sergei Eisenstein, the great theorist of montage, including The Cat's Cradle

(1959) and Anticipation of the Night (1958), which is considered his

breakthrough film. Of The Animals of Eden and After (1970), Brakhage has

written that the film "is too mysterious, to me, for me to be able to write

anything about it except that it seems to be the best film I've ever made."

<br /><span class="title"><a name="justa"></a>Just a Movie</span>



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Beginning with Bruce Conner's A Movie, the found-footage masterpiece

from the late 1950s, tonight's program samples the sampling that has become a

standard in recent avant-garde film. Pornographic materials are refashioned,

interrogated, and meditated upon in an amazing variety of ways in Peggy

Ahwesh's <i>The Color of Love</i> (1994)

and Scott Stark's <i>Noema</i> (1998),

among many others. In Naomi Uman's <i>Removed</i> (1999), female bodies are bleached out to leave men having intercourse

with white voids. Also included is Martin Arnold's <i>Pièce Touchée</i> (1989), which expands an 18-second sequence into 15

minutes of stuttering and then exhilirating motion. runs 122m&nbsp;

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Robert Breer's <i>Recreation</i>

(1956) and <i>Rubber Cement</i> (1976)

are just two examples of the playful films made by this famous animator.

Collisions between line drawings, live-action footage, found material, and

music and natural sound draw us into Breer's energetic and clever

constructions. Pat O'Neill, who runs a special effects company and has been

described as a technical wizard for his work with the optical printer, worked

for ten years on <i>Water and Power</i>

(1989) and for 17 years collecting ideas, images, and sounds for <i>Trouble in

the Image</i> (1996). O'Neill describes <i>Trouble</i> as "made up of dozens of performances dislodged from

other contexts." &nbsp; runs 104m&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="abigailchild"></a>Abigail Child</span>



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Is This What You Were Born For?</i> is a series of seven films, made between 1981 and 1989, by poet and

filmmaker Abigail Child. The films are dense, filled with imagery from film

noir, early cinema, pornography, home movies, and other sources. Child's

approach to the cutting of image and sound creates a virtuoso mosaic. The films

are powerful investigations of the portrayal of women and the construction of

identity and sexuality in pop culture. <i>Surface Noise</i> (2000) takes on a sonata form, again highlighting

Child's skill in constructing and manipulating complex sound montage and

continuing her investigation of issues of labor and class. runs 74m&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="larryjordan"></a>Larry Jordan</span>



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Once Upon a Time</i> (1974)

provides an example of the short cut-out animations that are the bulk of

Jordan's output. But like <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>, <i>Sophie's Place</i> (1986) extends Jordan's animation prowess to a longer format.

Hand-painted and cut-out images create a magical world inspired by Sophia,

goddess of wisdom, and revolve around the mosque of Saint Sophia in

Constantinople. The film is a rapid montage of magical objects that travel

across enchanted backgrounds, all transforming themselves mysteriously, all lushly

colored and meticulously composed. The landscapes Jordan creates are complex

and visually stunning.&nbsp; runs 102m&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="reports"></a>Reports</span>

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>In Report</i> (1963-67), an unforgettable meditation on the

assassination of JFK, Conner uses news footage and images from American mass

culture to critique both the media and our implicit participation in the

spectacle of violence. Peter Kubelka's <i>Unsere Afrikareise</i> (1961-66), Sonbert's <i>Noblesse Oblige</i> (1981), Craig Baldwin's <i>Tribulation 99</i> (1991), and Conner's <i>Television Assassination</i> (1963-95) all similarly recombine images and sounds

to question and often subvert their original contexts. runs 113m

<br />March 25&nbsp;7:00



<br /><span class="title"><a name="childrenof"></a>Children of Paradise</span>



<br />Marcel Carn&eacute;, 1945&nbsp;190m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Written by poet Jacques Prevert, this film shows the theatrical Paris of

epic romance, where words are sung, gestures are danced, and love's throws are

as light and intricate as lace. Its main characters - the pantomime artist

Baptiste Debureau, the romantic actor Frederick Lemaitre, and the criminal

Lacenaire - all fall in love with the beautiful actress/Aphrodite Garance (Arletty).

In a plot that twists like pre-Haussman streets, the three lovers find and lose

each other in the dense crowds parading along the Boulevard du Crime.

Flawlessly executed and with a peerless cast, this is one of the great French

films.&nbsp;&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="hoteldu"></a>H&ocirc;tel du Nord

</span>



<br />Marcel Carn&eacute;, 1938&nbsp;95m&nbsp;



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Doomed lovers Rene&eacute; (Annabella) and Pierre take a room at the H&ocirc;tel du

Nord in order to carry out a suicide pact. When the plot fails, Pierre escapes,

while Rene&eacute; becomes a maid at the hotel and joins its family of characters,

including Raymonde (Arletty), a vivacious and resilient prostitute, and Edmond,

her pimp. Based on a book by Eug&egrave;ne Dabit, whose parents owned the real H&ocirc;tel

du Nord, the film won the Prix populiste for its depiction of the people of the

northeast Paris neighborhood in which it is set. The film's success led to the

preservation of the hotel, which now has a restaurant named "Atmosph&egrave;re! Atmosph&egrave;re"

- one of the film's key phrases.&nbsp;

<br />Jean Vigo, 1933&nbsp;89m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>When Juliette (Dita Parlo) marries Jules, a Seine barge captain, the

villagers proclaim that "she always had to do things differently." Despite the

couple's obvious affection for one another and the romance of river travel

(beautifully rendered in black &amp; white), Juliette and Jules still have to

learn to live with each other, just like everyone else. They contend with the

added challenges of minimal space, an omnipresent crew, and a profusion of

cats. Away from home for the first time and lured by radio broadcasts from the

capital, Juliette dreams of visiting Paris, but when she and Jules are

prevented from seeing the city, will fulfilling her desire destroy her

marriage?&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />Vincent Minelli, 1951&nbsp;113m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>MGM's musical extravaganza spins an idealized Paris from the music of

Gershwin, the dancing of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, and a whimsical set

inspired by Impressionist paintings. Jerry Mulligan (Kelly), a struggling

American painter in post-war Paris, falls for the lovely fianc&eacute;e of a cabaret

singer.&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="zaziein"></a>Zazie in the Underground </span>



<br />Louis Malle, 1960&nbsp;&nbsp;89m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Foul-mouthed brat Zazie is sent to stay with her uncle, a female

impersonator, in Paris while her mother has a rendezvous with her latest lover.

Zazie terrorizes and escapes her uncle and sets out to explore the city by

metro, encountering possible child molesters, Marxist revolutionaries, and a

food fight along the way. Basing the film on a novel by Raymond Queneau, known

for his linguistic trickery, director Louis Malle (<i>My Dinner with Andre</i>) described this film as "trying to find some

equivalent to what Queneau was doing with literature." Malle draws on

slapstick, the Marx brothers, and cartoons to create an arresting visual style

and a hilarious satire of French society.&nbsp;

<br />Rene Clair, 1923&nbsp;65m



<br />Mad scientist Dr. Crase immobilizes all of

Paris with his latest invention, the crazy ray, except for a watchman and a

group of airplane passengers. Director Rene Clair explores the space of Paris

and the power of film to manipulate time. Live piano accompaniment by David

Drazin.



<br /><span class="title"><a name="alphaville"></a>Alphaville</span>



<br />Jean-Luc Godard, 1965&nbsp;99m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In the New Wave tradition of riffing off American film genres, <i>Alphaville</i> is part film noir, part sci-fi, part thriller - and

part social commentary. Director Jean-Luc Godard presents Paris as a futuristic

extra-terrestrial city ruled by a totalitarian technocratic computer whose only

law is logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />Eric Rohmer, 1995&nbsp;94m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Broken appointments make broken hearts in this assemblage of three tales

of young romance and modern times in Paris. In the first story, Esther finds

out the real reasons that Horace is endlessly "busy" for dinner. In the second,

a man and woman discuss their quasi-affair while wandering through Paris parks.

In the third, a painter has a date with a new muse, but follows his eyes to

another woman. On se donne des rendez-vous, on y va ou pas, et on tombe sur

qui, sur quoi? (Make a date, but do you go or no, and what if you run into

somebody else on the way?) The Paris of this film is spontaneous and reserved,

avant-garde and old world, trivial and philosophical.&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />Jean-Luc Godard, 1961&nbsp;90m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The most famous film of the French New Wave, <i>Breathless</i> exploded onto the international scene with stylistic

innovations and attitude to spare. Wanted criminal Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo)

tries to convince a young American (Jean Seberg) to flee with him to

Italy.&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="hate"></a>Hate</span>



<br />Mathieu Kassovitz, 1995&nbsp;96m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In this melo-docu-drama, three friends seek retribution when their best

friend suffers violence in police custody. An Arab, a Jew, and a black African,

they represent groups that tend to remain outside the p&eacute;ripherique, the highway

that encloses Paris. Residents of les banlieues, where much of the city's

subsidized housing is located, the friends form kinship out of their alienation

from the city and against regular sweeps of their neighborhood by police.

Director Mathieu Kassovitz draws on Spike Lee's 1989 Do the Right Thing, but

Kassovitz's portrayal of rage among les banlieusards focuses more closely on

the details of their mounting rage than on its stunning explosion. &nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="whattime"></a>What Time Is It There?</span>



<br />Tsai Ming-Liang, 2001&nbsp;116m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Hsiao-kang, a young street vendor who sells watches in Taipei, becomes

obsessed with a beautiful customer who says she is moving to Paris, and he

sells her his own wristwatch. Fixated on the idea of her living "in another

time," he compulsively sets all the clocks in Taipei back seven hours to Paris

time, even risking his life to reach clocks at the tops of city buildings.

Through a series of strange and cinematic coincidences, the two cities

gradually seem to converge. Director Tsai Ming-Liang (<i>The River</i>) adds to his darkly humorous blend of compulsion,

alienation, and superstition by using cinema and time zones to highlight the

modern distortions of time and space. &nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />Wim Wenders, 1984&nbsp;147m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>After wandering in the desert for four years with amnesia, Travis (Harry

Dean Stanton), presumed dead by family and friends, resurfaces to confront the

life he lost. His brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) tries to remind Travis of his

previous life, when he walked out on his wife and son. While attempting to

rebuild his relationship with his seven-year-old son, Hunter, Travis also tries

to locate his disillusioned wife, now working in a peep show. Winner of a

number of awards, including top honors at Cannes in 1984, the film uses sparse,

insightful dialogue and boasts an excellent soundtrack that suits the

sun-bleached landscapes and melancholic undertones.&nbsp;&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />Robert Altman, 1970&nbsp;105m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Bud Cort, the actor famous for his role in Harold and Maude (and for his

subsequent vanishing) stars as young Brewster McCloud in this early Robert

Altman fable. Brewster is a bookish, modern Icarus, constructing enormous wings

in his home, the fallout shelter of the Houston Astrodome, while getting fired

from a long string of odd jobs. He dreams of one day flying freely in the

Astrodome. People who cross him tend to die in freakish bird-related incidents,

but he doesn't mean any harm. . . This is Altman at his sprawling, epic best,

framing idiosyncratic human drama in the middle of the paved and deserted

landscape of urban Texas.&nbsp;

<br /><span class="title"><a name="realitybites"></a>Reality Bites</span>



<br />Ben Stiller, 1994&nbsp;99m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Reality Bites</i> tells the

story of four Generation-X friends experiencing the trials and tribulations of

post-collegiate depression.&nbsp;Vickie Miner (Janeane Garofalo) works at the

Gap, Lelaina Pierce (Winona Ryder) is a production assistant to a crotchety old

man with a bad talk show, Troy Dyer (Ethan Hawke) floats in and out of

meaningless jobs while contemplating existential bullshit, and Sammy Gray

(Steve Zahn) comes to terms with his sexuality.&nbsp;Ben Stiller, playing the

corporate sell-out, mixes things up by competing with Troy for Lelaina's love.

Reality Bites holds its own as a tribute to slacker life in young America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>
A controversial documentary of the highly publicized standoff in the

spring of 1993, this film opposes the FBI's claims that David Koresh and his

followers, the Branch Davidians, were a fringe cult that had themselves started

the fire which consumed their compound. The film uses footage from the siege

itself, the ensuing congressional hearings, and interviews with technical,

psychological, and religious experts. The filmmakers strongly suggest that the

group was in fact legitimate under the first Amendment, falling victim to the

ineptitude of an ATF (Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms) raid and the subsequent

prolonged standoff with FBI agents.&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />Richard Linklater, 1991&nbsp;97m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>This film wanders aimlessly through the streets of Austin, Texas,

following one pensive twenty-something after another as they try to articulate

their personal beliefs to anyone willing to listen. Characters include a UFO

buff who adamantly insists that the U.S. has been on the moon since the 1950s

and a woman who expertly hawks a glass slide of Madonna's pap smear. Remarkable

for its fluidity, Slacker covers a lot of ground around the sprawling

neighborhoods of Austin and maintains a bleak backdrop that is never quite

forgotten, even behind all the zaniness of the young, idealistic deadbeats and

social outcasts that keep the film interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />James Bridges, 1980&nbsp;132m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In James Bridges's irresistibly clich&eacute;d love story of a working man and

his ex-girlfriend, Bud Davis (John Travolta) is a strapping young farm lad who

moves to the city to work in an oil refinery. The relationship plays out in

Gilley's, a local honky-tonk hotspot where Bud rides a mechanical bull called "El

Toro" to catch the eye of the cowgirl of his dreams, Sissy Davis (Debra

Winger). Adding to the tantalizing blend of pure Western kitsch and regional

flavor, the soundtrack features hee-haw classics by Johnny Lee and Linda

Ronstadt. Who wouldn't want to catch John Travolta decked out in a cowboy hat

and chaps "lookin' for love in all the wrong places?"&nbsp;

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Hands on a Hard Body</i>

documents the 24 entrants of an annual contest sponsored by the local Nissan

three guys wanting to be wanted. Upon his release from a mental hospital,

Anthony (Luke Wilson) joins his eccentric, obsessed, and also mentally unstable

to begin a life of crime. Stumbling through Dignan's inept plot to fleece Mr.

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Written and directed by Gregory Nava, this semi-documentary film

chronicles Selena Quintanilla's rise to stardom and her eventual death. The

high points in this film are performances by Jennifer Lopez (who looks very

("Bidi-bidi-bom-bom"). The action plays out against the scenic backdrop of

Texas and the narrative backdrop of the struggles of a Mexican-American family

trying to make it big in both cultures. With Jennifer Lopez, bustiers, and

tejano music, what more do you need? Jennifer Lopez's performance and the power

of Selena's music and make for a bidi-bidi-bom-bomtastic movie. &nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

unexpected state of affairs throws Fink into a paralyzing case of writer's

block, which is interrupted (if not alleviated) by his odd and somewhat

overbearing neighbor, Charlie Meadows (John Goodman).&nbsp;Much like Sullivan's

Travels, however, this film is not at all what it seems to be, and its generic

shift takes the audience right down the rabbit hole alongside Fink. This is a

film that literally poses the question, "What's in the box,

in 1930, wakes up from fifty years of suspended animation and witnesses the love

story of J-21 and LN-18. Stephen Goosson's sets reference Hugh Ferriss's 1929

chronicles the decades of post-war suffering and the eventual triumph of

technology and reason, until a rocket launch to the moon spawns a debate about

the use of technology. &nbsp;

is an architect, there is a large number of inventive sets responding directly

the idea of the architect's role in society. Howard Roark (Gary Cooper) is a

rising architect with unorthodox ideas who dynamites a building that doesn't

conform with his plans and builds the world's tallest tombstone. The film is

based on Ayn Rand's novel, and Roark was inspired by Frank Lloyd

Tati) and his little nephew. The boy's parents live in an ultramodern villa,

and throughout the film there are references to modern design classics, such as

the street of futuristic cubic white houses (a critique of the rue

at Marienbad brings together two major figures of the post-war avant-garde. The

film sets up a puzzle that it never resolves: what happened last year at

camera explores the halls of the enormous château-hotel with gorgeous tracking

shots. A meditation on space, memory, and the cinematic mediation of reality

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>This overlooked noirish sci-fi mystery by Alex Proyas (The Crow) exudes

so much style and unique set design that it is easy to ignore the warm and

fuzzy message of the film's climax. John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakens in a

tub without any memories of who he is - and with murdered prostitutes in his

wake. As Murdoch stumbles through the sunless, industrial city trying to piece

together his memories, he is pursued by strange, floating men, a limping

scientist (Kiefer Sutherland), a police detective (William Hurt), and a woman

claiming to be his wife (Jennifer Connelly). Covered with a sheen of darkness,

grit, and disorientation, the vast noir metropolis is constantly being

transformed, making the Dark City a living character mixing Gothic, Victorian,

and post-Industrial architectural styles. Reflecting the dark mood and the

machinations of characters and physical space, composer Trevor Jones uses some

synthesizer, orchestra, male chorus, fervent string-playing, and some precise,

machine-like musical sounds. This visionary film redefined science fiction.

Gilliam portrays a vision of future living via technology from the 1940s, with

both office spaces and domestic interiors providing hellish versions of an

inhospitable future. Norman Garwood's sets are both nostalgic and futuristic,

making reference to films and architecture from the 1920s through the early

1980s, from Art Deco and Nazi monumentalism to junk-deco and postmodern

historical pastiche. Set "somewhere in the 20th century," the film follows our

hero, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), as he attempts to navigate his job at the

Ministry of Information while pursuing the woman of his dreams. He even enlists

the help of a black-market plumber (Robert de Niro) who exits by window and

gets smothered to death by the news. The difference between dream, reality, and

fantasy is left murky at best. Composer Michael Kamen had to disassemble the

title-track song, "Brazil," and symphonically reassemble it. He provides a

stunning score to complement the stunning visuals. Director's cut! &nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />Andrew Niccol, 1997&nbsp;101m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Set in a "brave new world" similar to our own, Gattaca delves into the

science and ethics of genetic engineering and its social repercussions. Janitor

Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) longs to travel into space but is restricted by

his lack of perfect genetic credentials and must assume the identity of Jerome

Morrow (Jude Law) in order to gain entry to the Gattaca Corporation.

Contrasting with a world of precise designs and cold emotions, Michael Nyman's

score provides the only warmth in this film.&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Astronaut Colonel Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his shipmates crash-land

on an unknown planet inhabited by intelligent apes and savage humans. Biting

social commentary on animal rights, nuclear war, religion, and the future of

the human race prove that Planet is more than just a typical space adventure.

Composer Jerry Goldsmith utilizes the orchestra and an array of unconventional

instruments to give the film a primitive but futuristic feel. Nominated for

Best Original Score. &nbsp;&nbsp;35mm &nbsp;

searching for Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), the wizard responsible for the

death of his parents and people, getting involved with warriors and a snake

cult on his way. The film that made Arnold famous, Conan is styled as a fantasy

opera with sparse dialogue and dominating themes composed by Basil Poledouris.

With powerful percussion reflecting the brutal, ancient world, Poledouris uses

chorus to mark Conan's status as a mythical hero. 35mm&nbsp;

<br />Alex Proyas,

1998&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>This overlooked noirish sci-fi mystery by Alex Proyas (<i>The Crow</i>) exudes so much style and unique set design that it

is easy to ignore the warm and fuzzy message of the film's climax. John Murdoch

(Rufus Sewell) awakens in a tub without any memories of who he is - and with

murdered prostitutes in his wake. As Murdoch stumbles through the sunless,

industrial city trying to piece together his memories, he is pursued by

strange, floating men, a limping scientist (Kiefer Sutherland), a police

detective (William Hurt), and a woman claiming to be his wife (Jennifer

Connelly). Covered with a sheen of darkness, grit, and disorientation, the vast

noir metropolis is constantly being transformed, making the Dark City a living

character mixing Gothic, Victorian, and post-Industrial architectural styles.

Reflecting the dark mood and the machinations of characters and physical space,

composer Trevor Jones uses some synthesizer, orchestra, male chorus, fervent

string-playing, and some precise, machine-like musical sounds. This visionary

film redefined science fiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

<br />Terry Gilliam,

1985&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142m



<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A hysterical dystopian romp through a thoroughly bureaucratized future.

Gilliam portrays a vision of future living via technology from the 1940s, with

both office spaces and domestic interiors providing hellish versions of an

inhospitable future. Norman Garwood's sets are both nostalgic and futuristic,

making reference to films and architecture from the 1920s through the early

1980s, from Art Deco and Nazi monumentalism to junk-deco and postmodern

historical pastiche. Set "somewhere in the 20th century," the film follows our

hero, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), as he attempts to navigate his job at the

Ministry of Information while pursuing the woman of his dreams. He even enlists

the help of a black-market plumber (Robert de Niro) who exits by window and

gets smothered to death by the news. The difference between dream, reality, and

fantasy is left murky at best. Composer Michael Kamen had to disassemble the

title-track song, "Brazil," and symphonically reassemble it. He provides a

stunning score to complement the stunning visuals. Director's cut! &nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

child prodigies, Margot the playwright (Gwyneth Paltrow), Richie the tennis pro

their precocity flared out. Their father, rhythmically played by Gene Hackman,

returns with news of his terminal illness and his need to make amends for his

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Welcome the new Rat Pack. In this star-studded remake of the 1961 film,

Danny Ocean (a Sinatra-esque George Clooney) is a fresh-outta-the-clink conman

who masterminds an unprecedented heist of three Las Vegas casinos with the

perfect team of ten eccentric partners, including a card shark

tutor-to-the-stars (Brad Pitt) and a rookie con-boy (Matt Damon). Ocean's got

worries, though - a bitter ex-wife (Julia Roberts), her control-freak lover (Andy

Garcia), and a British bomb expert (Don Cheadle) who's wholly unintelligible.

Unlike other recent drama-heavy heist films, Eleven is so quick with wit and

slick with cool that it all adds up to pure fun. Ring a ding indeed.&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

barber in a small post-war California town. Suspecting that his wife Doris

(Frances McDormand) is having an affair with her boss, Ed attempts to

anonymously blackmail him in order to invest in the revolutionary new service

of dry-cleaning. Things then rapidly deteriorate for Ed. The Coens combine

stark black-and-white cinematography reminiscent of 1940s noir with their own

flair for stories about infidelity and small men who make poor decisions (think

<i>Fargo</i>). Hauntingly existential,

come see this film if your life too is a long, empty corridor of numbness and

despair. Bring cigarettes.&nbsp; 35mm&nbsp;

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Ah yes, Hollywood has seen fit to produce the inevitable film adaptation

of British author J. K. Rowling's literary phenomenon. Young Harry Potter

(Daniel Radcliffe) lives a lonely life in a cupboard under the stairs of his

mean-spirited relatives' house, only to discover on his 11th birthday that he

is a wizard - and a famous one at that. Featuring an adult cast that reads like

a who's who of British acting elite, Sorcerer's Stone is remarkably faithful to

the original book of the same name. From 4 Privet Drive to the high-flying

Quidditch match, the film's images delight, leaving Muggle imaginations hungry

life, David shacks up with his friend's girlfriend Sofia (Penelope Cruz),

causing a past conquest (Cameron Diaz) to attempt to kill both herself and

David in revenge. David comes out alive, but with a horribly disfigured face.

The film then takes a Lynchian turn and concludes with an unbelievable twist

for a shooting party in Gosford Park, only to find themselves instead entangled

in a murder mystery. The group gathers at the country estate of Sir William

McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), expecting no

more than a parade of social courtesies and declarations of status. When one of

the guests is murdered, secrets are slowly revealed. Under the direction of the

colorful Robert Altman (<i>The Player, Short Cuts</i>), the impressive cast turns out strong performances

in a socially conscious film that ultimately exposes the relations between the

wealthy and those who work for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35mm &nbsp;

<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Writer/director Richard Linklater (<i>Slacker, Dazed and Confused</i>) creates a highly innovative film using a unique

combination of live-action and animation to meditate on the distinctions and

interplay of dreams, reality, cinema, and perception. Shot initially on digital

video, images were then painted by a team of animators, using a distinct visual

style for each episode as we follow the protagonist through a series of dream,

or dream-like, encounters. Whether it's a monkey delivering a film lecture,

Steven Soderbergh's cameo as a television commentator, or a treatise on the

sexual possibilities of lucid dreaming, <i>Waking Life</i> is full of smart surprises and flashes of

of Muhammad Ali, from his title fight in 1964 through "The Rumble in the

Jungle" in 1974. Mann (<i>Heat, The Insider</i>) perfects his visual style in Ali, conveying both the adrenaline rush

of the boxing match and the nervous tension surrounding a powerful

African-American in the Vietnam era. But the film belongs to Will Smith, who

expertly conveys both Ali's style and grace while sparring in the ring, and his

quick-witted but soft-spoken public presence. The supporting cast includes Jada

Pinkett Smith, Mario van Peebles, and Giancarlo Esposito as Cassius Clay,

American involvement in the civil war of Somalia. The plot of the movie centers

around a helicopter mission to the center of Mogadishu to capture lieutenants

of a Somali warlord. In a blunder, two helicopters are shot down (hence the

title), leading the remainder of the forces on a chase to rescue their fellow

soldiers. Veering away from the typical Bruckheimer-war-movie schlock (i.e. <i>Pearl

Harbor</i>), it presents the reality of

"peacekeeping" war in full-on combat scenes with an earnestness and special

effects skill not seen since the likes of Saving Private Ryan.&nbsp;&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

mistake results in a rejection letter. Shaun desperately enlists the help of

his girlfriend (Schuyler Fisk) and stoner-loser brother (Jack Black) to go to

Stanford and get his rightful spot on the admissions list - by any means

necessary. Orange County spouts its share of sex-comedy jokes, but ultimately

we must respect and sympathize with our noble surfer-turned-nerd

protaganist.&nbsp;35mm&nbsp;

Elijah Woods stars as a diminutive hero who vows to destroy an ancient relic

before it falls into the wrong hands. Look for outstanding performances from

Sir Ian McKellan (<i>Gods and Monsters</i>),

Sean Astin (<i>Rudy</i>), and Hugo

Solondz's most recent film presents a sharp satire of all that is socially holy

in bourgeois America. The center of this film is the creative impulses of

writing and filmmaking, presented in two segments, "Fiction" and "Non-Fiction."

In the first segment, a college student (Selma Blair of <i>Legally Blonde</i>) breaks up with her boyfriend, who has cerebral

palsy, and goes on to sleep with her creative writing professor. In the second

segment, Toby Oxman (Paul Giamatti) makes a documentary about a dysfunctional

and painfully middle-class family headed by a tyrannical father (John

In this first installment of Francis Ford Coppola's mafia trilogy, Vito's three

sons and his advisor Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) deal with an attempted hit on

the family boss, and the previously distant Michael (Al Pacino) becomes more

and more deeply involved in the family business. This is a touchstone for later

mafia films: the opening wedding sequence, the attempted assassination of Vito,

and the stunning montage in which the family "takes care of business" are all

among the best remembered scenes in film. In short, it's an offer you can't

mathematician in post-WWII America, is so blinded by his own brilliance that he

course, someone of such dynamism and intelligence can convince him that the

exterior world is as beautiful as his interior world. Alicia (the lovely

effort to connect with humanity, she sets out to return the box to its owner,

resulting in a newfound quest to help others. Along the way, she falls in love

designer dresses, perfect make-up, and modelish looks. She shares her talent by

performing makeovers and match-making for chosen students, ignoring the fact

that something in her life is missing. Good at shopping but bad at driving,

Cher learns that there is a much bigger world outside of her own. Ultimately,

though, this is a film about falling in love with your brother.
