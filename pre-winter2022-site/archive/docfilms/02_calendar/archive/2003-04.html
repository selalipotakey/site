Unwittingly entangling himself in the socioeconomic turmoil of the city, he is volunteered to fight the Germans in World War I. In its famous montage sequence, Russian soldiers die heroically in muddy trenches while stock-holders and capitalists greedily watch their profits grow. Often compared to Eisenstein's <i>October</i>, Pudovkin frames his film with the story of an individual rather than the masses. <i>16mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />October 12 7:00<br /><span class="title">Ivan the Terrible: Part 1</span><br />Sergei Eisenstein, 1944 96m<br /><span class="title">Ivan the Terrible: Part 2</span><br />Sergei Eisenstein, 1946 90m<p>This two-part epic portrayal of Ivan IV is one of Sergei Eisenstein's best-known films. <i>Part I</i> begins with the crowning of Tsar Ivan, a hopeful young leader who is focused on creating a united state out of 16th century Russia. But as he gains more power, his paranoia grows and he begins to mistrust even his closest friends. While <i>Part I</i> received the Stalin Award, <i>Part II </i>was an obvious critique of the dictator's practices, and would be banned until 1958. Eisenstein's third and final part would never be completed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>35mm</i></p>		<p>&nbsp;<br />October 19 7:00<br /><span class="title">Commissar</span><br />Aleksandr Askoldov, 1968 110m<p>Banned for 20 years by the Soviet government, <i>Commissar</i> tells the story of a tough, young Red Army commander, Klavdia, who becomes pregnant and is forced to stay with a Jewish family in the Ukraine. Although both sides are hesitant at first, Klavdia soon is overtaken by the warmth of the poor family and becomes a part of it. They protect her, and she lives happily for a while. But after the birth of her child, she learns that the White Army is advancing, and must choose between her military duties and her motherly ones.    </p>		<p>&nbsp;<br />October 26 7:00</span><span class="title">Siberiade</span><br />Andrei Konchalovsky, 1982 183m<p>This film is a true Russian historical epic. <i>Siberiade</i> follows two families, one wealthy and one poor, through six decades of Russian history. Three generations of the two families live through the changing political regimes and harsh economic systems of the first half of the 20th century. Beautifully filmed in the Siberian taiga, <i>Siberiade</i> is a rich romantic drama that explores the relationship between man and his environment. Watch for Konchalovsky's brother, Nikita Mikhalkov (<i>Burnt by the Sun</i>), in his robust performance of Aleksei. </p>			<p>&nbsp;<br />November 2 7:00<br /><span class="title">Come and See</span><br />Elem Klimov, 1985 142m<p>A brutal and haunting war film, <i>Come and See</i> centers around a young boy, Florya, who eagerly joins the Russian Army to fight the Nazis in World War II, but ultimately suffers psychological collapse. Director Elem Klimov experimented with sound in order to amplify the nihilistic power and nightmarish horror of his dark masterpiece. The film far surpasses the formulaic disillusionment with war of other films in its genre; <i>Come and See</i> is not for the faint of heart. Regarded by many as the best war film ever made, this film is definitely a must-see. Come prepared. Rare print!      </p><br />November 9 7:00<br /><span class="title">My Name is Ivan</span><br />Andrei Tarkovsky, 1962 84m<p>Ivan is twelve, going on forty. Alone in the war, trapped between memory and nightmare, Ivan becomes addicted to the cruelty of the front and rejects the chance to study as a cadet in order to scout behind enemy lines. Tarkovsky's first full-length feature became an international sensation for its stark depiction of wartime realities. It has remained seminal for its profound emotional depth and for its fresh presentation of Tarkovsky's favorite visual themes: the water, the horses, the art, the contemplative long-takes, the puzzling visual tricks. Watch for the ghost of Katasonych.              <i>16mm</i><br /></p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 16 7:00<br /><span class="title">Andrei Rublev</span><br />Andrei Tarkovsky, 1969 205m <p>The film that defied the limits of artistic expression in the Soviet Union and overturned ruling conceptions of film narrative. The life of Russia's legendary icon painter Andrei Rublev is told in a series of enigmatic vignettes, a fine narrative thread woven onto an epic, widescreen tapestry of Russian 15th century medieval history. Andrei is never shown at work and the austere landscape eschews any hint of the beauty he creates, at least until the embers of his life are completely consumed in the conflagration of history. Won the Critics' Prize at Cannes in 1969. </p>		<p>&nbsp;<br />November 23 7:00<br /><span class="title">Burnt by the Sun</span><br />Nikita Mikhalkov, 1994 152m<p>Set in 1936, <i>Burnt by the Sun</i> follows a military officer, Colonel Kotov, as he spends his peaceful summer with his wife and daughter in his dacha in the countryside. But when an uninvited but charming guest arrives from Moscow, issues of jealousy and trust are unearthed. Under Stalinist rule, the guest's strange arrival quickly rouses suspicions. Winner of the 1995 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, <i>Burnt by the Sun</i> is unforgettable, lyrical work of art. The superb cast glows under Mikhalkov's direction.     <i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 30 7:00<br /><span class="title">Russian Ark</span><br />Aleksandr Sokurov, 2002 96m<p>Sokurov's magnificent film gives us a floating tour of not only the Hermitage, but Russian history as well.  Through two ghost-like strangers, we meet Catherine, Peter the Great, Pushkin and Natalya, and even the young Anastasia. Although Sokurov captures the beauty of the museum, he also hints at Russia's dark past. Sergei Dreiden, representing Europe as the Marquis de Custine, is astounding as he leads the camera. Shot in a single take at Rastrelli's gorgeous state museum with nearly a thousand actors and extras, <i>Russian Ark</i> is destined to become a milestone in modern filmmaking.</p>															<p><a name="mon"></a><span class="series">Silent By Choice</span><p>&nbsp;<br />September 29 7:00<br /><span class="title">Flaming Creatures</span><br />Jack Smith, 1963 45m<p>To make this film, underground filmmaker/actor Jack Smith assembled a group of New York "creatures", or people whose gender lacks easy definition. Filmed on the  top of an old movie theater, these creatures interact in different scenes set to a strange musical collage. One of the most controversial films ever made, <i>Flaming Creatures</i> was banned by the state of New York and taken to the Supreme Court.  Now it is considered one of the most important films of avante garde cinema, having influenced several directors: including Fellini, Warhol, and of course, John Waters.                       </p>			<br />October 6 7:00</span><p>Films by Gregory Markopoulos, with:<br/><span class="title">Psyche</span> - 1947, 25m<br/><span class="title">Sorrows</span> - 1969, 6m<br/><span class="title">Twice a Man</span> - 1963, 49m<p><i>Twice a Man</i> is experimental filmmaker Markopoulos's brilliant adaptation of the myth of Hippolytus set in a Cold War era New York. Markopoulos illuminates the difficulty his characters have in communicating with one another in the use of the soundtrack, which is out of sync with what is happening onscreen. <i>Psyche</i> is an early film based on the novel by Pierre Louys and set to an excerpt from "Serenade" by Ralph Vaughan Williams. In <i>Sorrows</i>, we see inside the Swiss chateau that King Ludwig II built for Wagner, replete with music by Beethoven.</p><p>&nbsp;<br />October 13 7:00<br /><span class="title">Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son</span><br />Ken Jacobs, 1969 115m<p>Ken Jacobs, who worked with Jack Smith on some of his early films, became known in his own right with this film.  <i>Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son</i> takes a ten minute comic Bill Blitzer short from 1905 and re-photographs it, focusing on something new each time. Using countless techniques, Jacobs breaks down the short into small pieces. Eventually even stopping on single frames, the film becomes a meditation on movie watching. It is unique is not just for its insight, but also the absence of any sound at all. Jacobs has described his film as "seeing what film remembers, what it misses when it clocks by at normal speed. It tells us stories and much more."                <i>16mm</i><br /></p><p>&nbsp;<br />October 20 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Magick Lantern Cycle</span><br />Kenneth Anger, 1947-2002 169m<p>Former child star and dancing partner to Shirley Temple, Kenneth Anger began making films when he was just 11. <i>The Magick Lantern Cycle</i> is a compilation of most of the major works of this superstar of experimental film, who perhaps gained most of his notoriety from his scandalous tell-all book <i>Hollywood Babylon</i> in 1958. The films range over his entire filmmaking career but concern several similar themes, such as the occult, rock and roll, psychedelics, and Magik (the Alaister Crowley kind). These films often read more like highly developed, super-sophisticated music videos than movies. Don't miss this opportunity to see these films together.                       <i>16mm</i><br /></p>		<p>&nbsp;<br />October 27 7:00<br /><span class="title">Ashik Kerib</span><br />Sergei Paradjanov, 1988 78m<p>Ashik is a traveling minstrel who wants to marry the daughter of a rich Turk, but he hasn't got the necessary dough. The thousand day and thousand night journey Ashik must undergo to prove his love is the starting point for the great Armenian director's final film. Several elaborate wedding scenes show off Paradjanov's legendary images- rich, colorful and considered to be some of the most beautiful in contemporary Soviet cinema. Based on the poet Lermontov's tale of the same title, <i>Ashik Kerib</i> uses a unique score of Turkish and Azerbaijani folksongs to tell its story. Paradjanov dedicated this film to his admirer, Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky.       <i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 3 7:00<br /><span class="title">Conspirators of Pleasure</span><br />Jan Svankmajer, 1996 85m<p>Six tales of loneliness from master Czech filmmaker Svankmajer (<i>Alice, Faust</i>) are rendered without one word. Six individuals, a postwoman, a shopkeeper, television presenter, detective and two strange apartment dwellers wander around Prague searching for some strange ingredients for a very special feast. We also see the bizarre fetishes of each player, such as the guy who likes to touch the skin of live fish, or the chicken guy. Using unusual camera techniques, weird sounds without dialogue, and Svankmajer's inimitable stop motion animation, the audience is drawn into the conspiracy as well.  A surreal, magical and erotic adventure that is also uproariously funny. <i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 10 7:00<br /><span class="title">Powaqqatsi: Life in Transformation</span><br />Godfrey Reggio, 1988 99m<p>After spending 14 years in silence studying to be a Catholic monk, Godfrey Reggio made his <i>Qatsi</i> Trilogy, of which <i>Powaqqatsi</i> is the second. As with the other two, the title comes from a Hopi phrase. This part of the trilogy centers on the peoples and cultures of the developing world. It is Reggio's intention to show the impact that the modern world and technology has on our lives, and he does this with his images of people all over the world in their daily lives. With a score by U. of C. alum Philip Glass, this is the most important and best conceived installment of Reggio's postmodern, artistic mission statement.                 </p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 17 7:00<br /><span class="title">Cremaster: Parts 4 and 5</span><br />Matthew Barney, 1994 &amp; 1997 97m<p>These movies represent a large part of <i>The Cremaster Cycle</i>, sculptor Mathew Barney's visually arresting moving picture creation. One of the many things Barney does in these films is take apart firm genres and create something of an entirely new order.  In <i>Cremaster 4 and 5</i>, he does this with action adventure and 19th century decadence. Shown at a recent retrospective of his work at the Guggenheim, Barney's work was wildly popular. His work is not available for private viewing (unless you want to cough up $300,000 for the DVD at Sotheby's).   Note that <i>Parts 1 and 2</i> will be shown Saturday, November 8 and <i>Part 3</i> will be shown on Friday, November 14.</p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 24 7:00<br /><span class="title">*Corpus Callosum</span><br />Michael Snow, 2002 92m</span>			<p><i>Corpus Callosum</i> is the most recent work from the jazz musician/film artist Michael Snow, who has been making films since 1967's intense <i>Wavelength</i>.  Shot on digital video, it is set in an office and a suburban house and uses images from Snow's long career. Named for part of the brain once thought to contain the human soul, Snow's experimental movie plays, bends, and generally manipulates at his will all conventions of modern film, including time. Don't be surprised to see the credits roll midway through the film - that's just one more of Snow's little tricks. The soundtrack is full of bells, hums, and buzzing, adding humor to this extremely original work.                     <i>16mm</i><br /></p><p>&nbsp;<br />December 1 7:00<br /><span class="title">Film of Her</span><br />Bill Morrison, 1997 12m<br /><span class="title">Decasia</span><br />Bill Morrison, 2002 70m<p>Bill Morrison (a Hyde Park native!) breathed new life into experimental cinema with <i>Decasia</i>, using old film stock shown in the actual process of decay. A silent procession of random images - nuns, pyramids, and belly dancers to name just a few - flash across the screen against a haunting score by Bang on a Can's Mark Gordon. A very excited Errol Morris says, "This may be the greatest movie ever made!" <i>Film of Her</i> is the  tale of a clerk whose obsessive search through  the archives of the Library of Congress for a picture of an old porn star leads him to a treasure of forgotten film. <i>16mm</i></p>													<p><a name="tue"></a><span class="series">Satyajit Ray</span><p>&nbsp;<br />September 30 7:00<br /><span class="title">Pather Panchali</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1955 115m<p>Ray's first film, the first of <i>The Apu Trilogy</i>, and universally acknowledged (with its siblings) to be one of the great masterpieces of Indian and world cinema. Apu (Subir Bannerjee) is the baby of a Bengali Brahmin family struggling to make ends meet. Ray's simple, effortless storytelling helped this film to be the first Indian film to make waves in the West, its images of ordinary events drenched in the humanity of the director's eye. The gentle, rambling film follows him and his mischievous sister Durga as they long for candy, discover a train, witness a marriage ceremony, become theater patrons, and listen to the stories of their ancient aunt Indir. New print!    </p>		<p>&nbsp;<br />October 7 7:00<br /><span class="title">Aparajito</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1957 127m<p>Released in the US as <i>The Unvanquished</i>, this is the second film of Ray's <i>Apu Trilogy</i>. Apu, now a boy of ten, (and a new actor - this time it is Smaran Ghosal) is living on the banks of the Ganges while his parents eke out a meager living. After Apu's father dies, his mother wants him to become a priest, but he convinces her to let him go to school. When he turns sixteen, he wins a scholarship and leaves for Calcutta; caught in the whirlwind of city life, he grows away from his mother, who is deeply hurt by the widening emotional distance. Notice the recurring use of trains that Ray uses to symbolize personal change for his young protagonist.  New print!    </p>	<p>&nbsp;<br />October 14 7:00<br /><span class="title">Apu Sansar</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1959 117m<p>The final installment of <i>The Apu Trilogy, The World of Apu</i> finds our hero dealing with the harsh realities of adulthood.  Through a bizarre chain of events driven by the idiosyncrasies of ritual, a matriculated but unemployed Apu (the third actor to play this everyman character, Soumitra Chatterjee) finds himself married to a woman he doesn't know. After a brief stint of surprising marital bliss, Apu's wife dies during childbirth, and Apu, crushed, refuses to acknowledge the child and leaves Calcutta to wander aimlessly. After five years, Apu's friend finds him and demands that he take responsibility for the child - a classic ending to this timeless epic.  New print! </p>			<p>&nbsp;<br />October 21 7:00<br /><span class="title">Devi</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1960 93m<p>This film takes place on a rural estate in nineteenth-century Bengal. The aging patriarch of the estate dreams that his married teenage daughter is an incarnation of the goddess Kali and insists she be worshipped. Events transpire, and soon the crippled and infirm, from villages far and wide, are coming to the "goddess" to be cured (who comes to the goddess of destruction to be cured?), and even the girl herself becomes convinced of her divinity. <i>New Yorker </i>critic Pauline Kael, in typical pretentiously meaningless mode, called this "one of the rare, honest films about decadence."  What that means you can figure out for yourself. New print!   <i>35mm</i></p>		<p>&nbsp;<br />October 28 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Expedition</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1962 150m</span><p><i>Abhijan</i> is a film about a taxi driver named Narsingh (Ray's favorite, Soumitra Chatterjee) who is forced into exile in a small border town and, naturally, the adventures - drug smuggling, Catholic girls, prostitutes, the old spot of violence - that befall him there. This movie is about many things, including  pride, the temptations of lawlessness on the margins, drugs, religion, goodness, the prejudices of purity, love and love triangles, and, above all, vintage cars and their fetishization.  Despite having been a major box-office success in India, this film has rarely been shown in the United States. Doc will be showing a glorious, new print!   </p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 4 7:00<br /><span class="title">Charulata</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1964 117m<p>Charu (Madhabi Mukherjee), the film's heroine, is the beautiful and intelligent wife of Bhupati, an upper-class intellectual who edits and publishes a political newspaper in 1870s Bengal. Bhupati loves his wife, but has no time for her; Charu, with nothing to do and an inattentive husband, sits around stewing with boredom. When Bhupati's younger, more handsome cousin comes for an extended visit, the would-be writer helps nurture Charu's intellect. After several months, he and the lonely wife develop an intimate relationship. Ray reportedly named <i>Charulata</i> the one film he would not have changed anything about.    <i>16mm</i><br /></p>			<p>&nbsp;<br />November 11 7:00<br /><span class="title">Nayak: The Hero</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1966 120m<p>Written and directed by Ray, <i>Nayak</i> concerns a fictional Indian film star named Arindam (Uttam Kumar) who boards a train to get an award. He ends up in a conversation with an earnest young woman (Sharmila Tagore) that soon becomes an interview for her newspaper.  Throughout their conversation, sub-plots emerge related to the interaction between the star and the reporter involving a swami, an advertising executive and his wife, and a cantankerous old man. By the end of the overnight train ride, both characters reach revelations. Ray invests this film with the humanism that became his trademark.  </p>			<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<br />November 18 7:00<br /><span class="title">Company Limited</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1971 110m<p>The universal 'Corrupting Ambition' story makes its way to Calcutta with Ray's <i>Seemabadha</i>. Shyamal is head of marketing for a British fan-manufacturing firm; he dreams (as do we all) of someday joining the board of directors.  But, one day, he learns that a batch of fans set aside for export is defective.  There isn't enough time to fix the defect without jeopardizing the contract and Shyamal's chances of promotion, so, pregnant with Capital-ism's demands, he gives birth to a scheme.  This is the second film of <i>The Calcutta Trilogy</i> and has never been shown in the United States.  We will be showing a beautiful, new print!     <i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 25 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Branches of the Tree</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1990 130m<p>One of Ray's last films, <i>Shakha Proshakha</i> tells the story of Ananda (Ajit Bannerjee), a retired industrialist enjoying the twilight of his life. When he collapses at his seventieth birthday party, his four sons gather to keep watch over his recovery.  While they sit at his bedside, the sons reveal to each other exactly what they've been doing lately - that is, things they wouldn't want their father, an uncompromising moralist, to find out about. What they don't realize is that the seemingly comatose patriarch hears every word they're saying. A wonderful film to end to this celebrated filmmaker's career, we will be showing another wonderfully restored, new print!     </p>				<p>&nbsp;<br />December 2 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha</span><br />Satyajit Ray, 1968 132m<p>An Indian take on the age-old fairy-tale trope of the incompetent outcast(s) embarking on an adventurous journey and eventually winning the princess's hand and half the kingdom. Goopy and Bagha are exiled from their respective kingdoms for being obstinately enthusiastic but hideously untalented musicians.  The King of Ghosts, whom they meet in the forest, gives them magical slippers that correct their musical deficiencies, and they return to the kingdom of Shundi and become the court musicians.  But the King of Halla, drugged by an evil magician, wants to declare war on Shundi.

But, when "the fastest gun alive" tries to settle down on a local ranch, he gets more than he bargained for. Reluctant to kill and always ready to teach the fatherless Joey a lesson in etiquette, Shane is the first of a new breed of gunslingers, a thing that the notorious Ryker (Jack Palance) gang is trying to destroy. George Stevens' slow style and the Oscar-winning photography of Loyal Griggs redefined the genre and set the standard for all future Westerns.      </p><p>&nbsp;<br />October 8 7:00<br /><span class="title">Johnny Guitar</span><br />Nicholas Ray, 1954 110m</SPAN><SPAN class="dynamic-style-26"><p>Ray (<i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>) reinvents the Western with this film about two tough women. The saloon owner Vienna (a raunchy Joan Crawford who professes, "Down there I sell whiskey and cards. All you can buy up these stairs is a bullet in the head. Now which do you want?") and the cattle baroness (Mercedes McCam-bridge) fight over money and men while the ostensible cowboy Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden) would rather just play his guitar. Criticized in America, Ray became the hero of the French new wave, garnering praise from Eric Rohmer, Jean-Luc Godard, and François Truffaut as "the poet of love and violence."

Beginning with a stagecoach hold-up where the tough but lovable villain Usher (Richard Boone) shoots a man and steals his newlywed and newly-widowed wife for ransom, and ending with the inevit-able showdown between Usher and the ranch-hand Brennan (Boetticher standby Randolph Scott), the film takes a fresh take on issues of social justice with Usher and Brennan becoming simply two sides of the same coin. With stark camera work and a story adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel, this is one of the first movies to mix suspense into the Western genre.     </p>			<p>&nbsp;<br />October 22 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Magnificent Seven</span><br />John Sturges, 1960 128m<p>When a Mexican town comes under assault, a team of seven gunslingers (an amazing cast featuring Yul Brenner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn) is hired to fight off the hundred-some bandits.  Though the theme of a group of heroes coming together, each with their own private reasons, for one big final blow-out has been often mimicked, never has there been an instance where each character is so complete as in this Sturges masterpiece. An Americaniz-ation of Kurosawa's <i>Seven Samurai</i>, the demon-laden and unfulfilled seven are the most famous motley crew in film history.     <i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />October 29 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence</span><br />John Ford, 1962 120m<p>Nowhere does Ford (<i>My Darling Clementine</i>) show the tensions between the Old and New West so tautly as here where a well-loved senator (James Stewart), made famous for being "the man who shot Liberty Valence," comes home to attend the funeral of his old friend and gunslinger (John Wayne). As Stewart wipes the dust from a stagecoach, it becomes clear that it is not only Wayne but  the greater romanticism of the olden days that's being buried.

Based on Kurosawa's <i>Yojimbo</i>, Eastwood, in his breakout role, is more supercool and smart than his rough n' tumble predecessors like John Wayne or Wallace Beery. Bloody and ultraviolent, the film tells the story of two rival families whom Eastwood plays off each other, luring them into shootouts, in order to make himself rich. Eastwood, who plays the poncho-wearing, mule-riding Joe, "the man with no name," became known as the quintessential anti-hero with this film and his following Leone films.</p><br />November 12 7:00<br /><span class="title">3:10 to Yuma</span><br />Delmer Daves, 1957 92m<p>In desperate need of help from a severe drought, a hard-working farmer (Van Helfin) agrees to escort a notorious gang-leader (Glenn Ford) to the train station so that he can get to the Yuma courthouse. But, as time passes, it becomes clear that the captor has become the captive. Using psychological dialogue - adapted from an Elmore Leonard story - and highly taut filmmaking, Daves creates a complex scenario where two men, each of whom envy something in his counterpart, become both hateful of and dependent on one another. This film is Slavoj Zizek's favorite western.         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 19 7:00<br /><span class="title">Once Upon a Time in the West</span><br />Sergio Leone, 1968 165m<p>It begins with the noises of silence. A man wrestles with a fly in the deadly desert sun. The creak of a turning windmill haunts the background. Then the gunfire begins. The sadistic but heavenly-eyed Frank (Henry Fonda) is working for the railroad by killing anyone who stands in its way. But, when a rugged stranger (the late Charles Bronson), known only by the echoing strains from his harmonica, comes to town and teams up with known outlaw Cheyenne, it becomes a fair fight. The story (co-written by none other than Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento) eventually uncovers the truth about each character and why their final battle is a thing of destiny.        <i>35mm </i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 26 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Wild Bunch</span><br />Sam Peckinpah, 1969 145m<p>The Old West is dying. It is surrounded like the scorpion at the start of Peckinpah's epic film. This is the setting for the last stand of a group of nine aging outlaws, led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), whose attempts at a final bank heist have failed and who are now retreating to Mexico. Though unabashedly fierce and brutal, the gang is still portrayed as an honorable force of justice in a world corrupted by the greedy magnates of the East. With nothing to lose, the down-and-out criminals plan one last heist, this time targeting the Mexican army. The film's final, savage sequence was revolutionary for its uncompromising gore.             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />December 3 6:30<br /><span class="title">McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</span><br />Robert Altman, 1971 120m<p>A non-heroic western that presaged <i>Unforgiven</i> by many years, Altman's (<i>Nashville</i>, <i>Godsford Park</i>) protagonist John McCabe (Warren Beatty) - a charismatic but stupid braggart, a crummy lover, and a poor businessman with indigestion that's even worse - comes West to set up a whorehouse with the help of the opium-addled Mrs. Miller. But in this new West, things aren't always what they appear - the ground is covered with snow instead of sand, corporations are bigger killers than outlaws, and it takes more luck than skill to survive.                  <i>16mm</i><br /></p>										<p><a name="thu"></a><span class="series">English Hitchcock</span><p>&nbsp;<br />October 2 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Pleasure Garden</span>			<br />Alfred Hitchcock, 1925   75m<p>Alfred Hitchcock shot most of this, his first film, in Germany's Emelka Studios using  "American" lighting and staging techniques, but critic Charles Barr notes the inventive use of cross-cutting and Soviet influence.

For his third, he returned from Germany to England and helmed <i>The Lodger</i>, which has remained popular with critics who note the film's many hallmarks of the Hitchcockian style, leaving audiences to be taken by the suspense and murder. A serial killer stalks London by night for new blonde victims. A strange man takes the room the Buntings are letting. Is he the killer?

When he recognizes a glove at the scene of a crime as belonging to Alice, he stuffs it in his pocket. But he's not the only person who can connect her with the murder.

Later, he was not convinced at all, and started making inquiries of his own. Though made entirely as a sound film, Hitchcock kept some interesting silent techniques such as photographic inserts and the surrealist floor of Sir John's office, but used sound in such innovative ways as in the jury's pronouncement, heard but not seen, and Sir John's auditory off-stage trickery.

The film features an amazing single shot, crossing 145 feet of a ballroom to end up just four inches from the eyes of the drummer in the band.

Gary Ross explains their situation: "Red lost his family, Howard lost a son and Smith lost his way of life. How do you transcend that kind of pain, overcome the grief?" Taking place during the depression, which many equate to a lack of spirit today, it is a story of reaching potential, a story of second chances.             </p>												<p>&nbsp;<br />November 22 6:30, 9:00, 11:30<br /><span class="title">Terminator 3:  Rise of the Machines</span><br />Johnathan Mostow, 2003 108m<p>He's baaack!  That's right, the 56 year-old, would-be governor, Austrian juggernaut has returned, and this time, he's... well, he's much the same as he was before. Sent from a no-longer-as-distant-as-it-once-was future, the Terminator robot (Ahnold) is again responsible for the safety of the now 20-something, future resistance leader John Connor (Nick Stahl). This time, however, he will have to do battle with a far fiercer and sexier evil-robot known as the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken) as he again makes sure the world is safe from the fast-approaching Judgment Day.    <i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />November 28 6:30, 9:00, 11:30<br /><span class="title">Swimming Pool</span><br />Francois Ozon, 2003 103m<p>After the success of <i>8 Women</i>, the fabulous Francois Ozon tackles his first English-language picture with the return of two of his favorite actresses. When aging mystery author Sarah Morton (the subtle Charlotte Rampling) decides to relieve herself of her dreary London life to unravel some nerves and find literary inspiration in her publisher's vintage house in south France, things can't seem to get any better. That is, until his young sleazy daughter (Ludivine Sagnier) arrives unexpectedly to upset the tranquility, dragging in a frothy mixture of sexual intrigue and perilous sass. Ah...the things you'll uncover when two sexy women dive under the pool.     </p>					<p>&nbsp;<br />November 29 6:30, 9:00, 11:30 <br /><span class="title">Matchstick Men</span><br />Ridley Scott, 2003 116m<p>Roy (Nicolas Cage) is an obsessive-compulsive grifter with a phobia of dirt.  When he isn't looking for his next mark with ambitious prot&eacute;g&eacute; Frank (Sam Rockwell), he's scrubbing his house and avoiding all human contact. The life of a flimflam man is a lonely one, apparently, until Roy's shrink sets up a surprise meeting with his estranged daughter.  Soon, the 14-year-old girl and her trickster father are running their own racket, making out like the bandits they are.  Ridley Scott's (<i>Black Hawk Down</i>, <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>) latest is not your run-of-the-mill crime comedy, but rather an entertaining character study of a man who learns to break out of his shell.          <i>35mm</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br />December 5 6:45, 9:00, 11:15<br /><span class="title">American Wedding</span><br />Jesse Dylan, 2003 97m</span>			<p>It seems like only a year ago they were just a pair of masturbating losers, he with an apple pie and she with a wind instrument.  Now, one film later, they're getting married. As the final installment of everybody's favorite sophomoric sex-romp trilogy, <i>American Wedding</i> reunites the cast for one last big night on the town in the form of Jim's (Jason Biggs) bachelor party. Things get dicey, however, when the mischievous Stiffler (Sean William Scott) becomes enamored with (or at least horny for) the little sister of Jim's bride-to-be (Alyson Hannigan).  Be ready for the raunchiest film of the new holy trinity of teen comedy.            <i>35mm</i></p>								<p>&nbsp;<br />December 6 7:00, 9:00, 11:00<br /><span class="title">The Weather Underground</span><br />S. Green &amp; B. Siegel, 2002 92m<p>Named for a line in a Bob Dylan song, the Weathermen were a far-left faction of the Students for a Democratic Society that were infamous for a string of bombings and for encouraging the Days of Rage in Chicago. The anti-war group (later known as the Weather Under-ground) were fighting for the motto: "Bring the war back home." This documentary uses interviews of several former members of the group and archival footage to bring the audience back to the late 60s to try to analyze the politics and intentions of this militant group. Green and Siegel have created a brilliant, frank, and insightful treatment of this chaotic and timely subject.    <i>35mm</i></p>						  <p><a name="matinee"></a><span class="series">Sunday Matinee</span><p>&nbsp;<br />October 5 2:00<br /><span class="title">Bend it Like Beckham</span></p><p>October 12 2:00<br /><span class="title">X2:  X-Men United</span></p><p>October 19 2:00<br /><span class="title">Pirates of the Caribbean</span></p><p>October 26 2:00<br /><span class="title">A Mighty Wind</span></p>								<p>November 2 2:00<br /><span class="title">Finding Nemo</span></p>			<p>November 9 2:00<br /><span class="title">The Matrix:  Reloaded</span></p>			<p>November 16 2:00<br /><span class="title">Chicago</span></p>			<p>November 23 2:00<br /><span class="title">Terminator 3:  Rise of the Machines</span></p><p>November 30 2:00<br /><span class="title">Matchstick Men</span></p></td>            </tr>        </table>        <p><br><span class="copy">        &copy; 2000-2001 Doc Films &amp; The University of Chicago </span>        </td>        <td valign="top"><table border="0" cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0" width="110">            <tr>                <td valign="top"><a href="calendar.html" onMouseOver="activateImg1()" onMouseOut="deactivateImg1()"><img src="calendar1.gif" name="rollover1" border="0"></a><br />				<a href="events.html" onMouseOver="activateImg4()" onMouseOut="deactivateImg4()"><img src="special1.gif" name="rollover4" border="0"></a><br />				<a href="directions.html" onMouseOver="activateImg2()" onMouseOut="deactivateImg2()"><img src="directions1.gif" name="rollover2" border="0"></a><br />                <a href="volunteer.html" onMouseOver="activateImg5()" onMouseOut="deactivateImg5()"><img src="volunteers1.gif" name="rollover5" border="0"></a><br />				<a href="about.html" onMouseOver="activateImg6()" onMouseOut="deactivateImg6()"><img src="about1.gif" name="rollover6" border="0"></a><br />				<a href="index.html" onMouseOver="activateImg3()" onMouseOut="deactivateImg3()"><img src="home1.gif" name="rollover3" border="0"></a><br /><br>                </td>            </tr>        </table>        </td>    </tr></table></body></html>
