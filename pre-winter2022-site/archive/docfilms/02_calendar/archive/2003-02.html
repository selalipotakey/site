April 6 7:00<br /><span class="title">A Voyage to Italy</span><br />
Roberto Rossellini, 1953 100m<p>
<i>A Voyage to Italy</i> stars Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders as a long-married British couple. A trip to Italy exposes the frayed edges of their troubled relationship, and their mutual boredom and discontent is contrasted with the beauty and sensuality of the Italian landscape. In one memorable scene, they visit the ruins of Pompeii and view the mummified remains of two embracing bodies. A commercial disaster when it was initially released, <i>A Voyage to Italy</i> was later rediscovered by critics and filmmakers of the French New Wave, who deemed it a masterpiece. Come see this rare, fully restored archival print.  <i>35mm</i></p>
<p>
April 13 	7:00<br />
<span class="title">Ossessione</span><br />
Luchino Visconti, 1943 142m<p>
This, Visconti's first film, is an adaptation of the James M. Cain novel <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>. Set in fascist-era Italy, it concerns a handsome drifter (Massimo Giroti) and a bored, sultry young wife who fall in love and plan to murder her much older husband. Featuring foregrounded heterosexual relationships and a gay subplot, the film is far more openly erotic than Hollywood dared. <i>Ossessione</i> is one of the seminal works of the neo-realist film movement, but because Visconti's use of the source material was unauthorized, it was not shown in the U.S. until the 1970s.</i></p>
<p>

April 20  7:00<br />
<span class="title">Open City</span>
<br />Roberto Rossellini, 1945 100m<p>
<i>Open City </i>is the classic film that launched the neo-realist movement. Internationally acclaimed for its vivid immediacy and raw, semi-documentary style, it concerns the underground resistance movement in Rome during the Nazi occupation. Non-professional actors were used for many supporting roles and the film depicts real-life events. Aldo Fabrizi is memorable in the role of an antifascist priest. The screenplay was written by Rossellini, Sergio Amidei, and Federico Fellini in only one week. Short on funds, Magnani and Rossellini sold their clothes to complete the film.</i></p>


<p>

April 27 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Shoe Shine</span>
<br />Vittorio De Sica, 1946 93m<p>
This lyrical, heartbreaking film portrays the friendship of Pasquale and Guisseppe amidst the poverty of postwar Rome. Racehorses fascinate the two young boys and they save money to one day buy one for themselves. When the two run black market items, they quickly become involved with hoodlums and are arrested. Made by De Sica two years before <i>The Bicycle Thief</i>, it is also a social protest film centered on themes of innocence and corruption. <i>Shoe Shine</i> was so well-regarded that it was awarded the first Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. </p>
<p>

May 4 	7:00<br />
<span class="title">La Terra Trema</span><br />
Luchino Visconti, 1948 160m<p>
Visconti's second film, <i>La Terra Trema </i>(a.k.a. <i>The Earth Will Tremble</i>) is a neo-realist tragedy set amongst the impoverished fishermen of Sicily. The fishermen are  exploited by opportunistic merchants who collude to keep the market price of fish unfairly low. One young man (Antonio Arcidiacono) returns home from war determined to change things. In keeping with the neo-realist approach, Visconti makes extensive use of documentary techniques. <i>La Terra Trema </i>was filmed on location in the isolated village of Acitrezza, and the cast is exclusively made up of non-professional actors speaking in their own dialect.</i></p>
May 11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Umberto D.</span><br />
Vittorio De Sica, 1952 91m<p>
<i>Umberto D.</i> concerns an elderly retired bureaucrat (Carlo Battisti, a University of Florence professor)who has fallen on hard times. Poor, but too proud to beg, and lonely, but too stubborn to reach out, he has only his dog to keep him company.  Umberto scrambles to come up with rent before he and his terrier are evicted from their home, and must withstand the shame of impoverishment and the humiliations of his situation--his apartment is infested with ants and serves as a rendez-vouz for illicit romances. A poignant film about the hardships of aging alone, <i>Umberto D</i>. is one of De Sica's finest accomplishments.   <i>35mm</i></p>
May 18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00<br />
<span class="title">I Vitelloni</span><br />
Federico Fellini, 1953 104m<p>
Considered by many to be his finest film, this is the work that catapulted Fellini to international prominence. <i>I Vitelloni  </i>("The Slackers") is an autobiographical tale of five friends in Fellini's seaside hometown of Romini, Italy. Portrayed with warm affection and satiric humor, these spoiled, frustrated young men have big dreams, but fritter their lives away in trivial pursuits. The cast includes Franco Interlenghi as Moraldo, Fellini's alter-ego, and the only member of the group ultimately able to break free of his futile existence. This film inspired countless other movies, including <i>Mean Streets</i>.</p><p>

May 25 	7:00<br />
<span class="title">L' Avventura</SPAN><SPAN class="dynamic-style-6"></span><br />
Michelangelo Antonioni, 1960  145m<p>
Antonioni's hauntingly enigmatic film follows a group of idle rich travelers cruising the Mediterranean. Anna (Lea Massari) disappears during a stop at a desolate island. Her fianc&eacute; Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) and best friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) search for her, but gradually they become more interested in each other than in finding Anna. With this film, Antonioni moved decisively away from his neo-realist roots and planted himself firmly in the modernist camp. In an attempt to convey the emptiness and alienation of the world he depicts, he deliberately eschews conventional narrative.    <i>35mm</i></p>
<p>
June 1 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Il Posto</span><br />
Ermanno Olmi, 1961                 90m<p>
This film, the second feature by the future director of the acclaimed <i>Tree of Wooden Clogs </i>(1978), follows Domenico (Sandro Panseri), a wide-eyed innocent from the provinces, as he heads to Milan in search of "un posto sicuro" (a steady job). Combining the naturalistic observation of the neo-realists with a kind of absurdist comedy of the workplace that foreshadows films like <i>Office Space, Il Posto</i> depicts Domenico's progress through the dehumanizing, bureaucratic labyrinth of the corporate world. Ermanno Olmi leavens his sometimes grim vision with tenderness, lyricism, and even romance.     <i>35mm</i></p>


<br /><a name="chicago"></a><span class="series">Mondays: Chicago Stories</span><br /><br />
March 31 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Scarface</span>
<br />Howard Hawks, 1932 93m<p>
Loosely based on Al Capone, the ambitious and animalistic Tony "Scarface" Camonte (Paul Muni) rises through the ranks of the South Side mob. He builds up and takes over his boss' liquor racket and assails the competition. With many violent set pieces staged directly from Chicago's gang wars of the period, Hawks' influential gangster film also capitalized on the newspaper convention of representing a corpse's location with an X. He visually located X shapes where ever possible in the film and used the reported practice of leaving a nickel in a murder-victim's hand as inspiration for George Ratt's famous coin-flipping.</p>

<p><br />April 7 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Call Northside 777</span>
<br />Henry Hathaway, 1948 111m<p>
Cynical <i>Chicago Times</i> reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart) becomes convinced of a prisoner's innocence after reluctantly taking the family's human-interest story.  But McNeal meets indifference and hostility from a justice system unwilling to accept his findings: official interference, coached witnesses, prosecutorial incompetence, and even mob involvement. Based on a true Chicago story, <i>Call Northside 777</i>  expresses the post-war documentary realism style inspired by wartime newsreels and features including <i>Open City</i>. Location shooting ranges from the Loop and the Wrigley Building to Chicago's prison system. <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />April 14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00<br />
<span class="title">A Raisin in the Sun</span>
<br />Daniel Petrie, 1961 128m<p>
Lena moved to Chicago with her husband in seach of opportunity, but years of working in low-wage jobs has kept her family living in a cramped South Side apartment. When her husband dies, the $10,000 of insurance money promises a better life, but the different family members fiercely debate how best to achieve that goal. Lena wishes for her own home, her underemployed son Walter Lee (Sidney Poitier) wants to buy his own business, his wife Ruth is expecting a baby, and sister Beneatha desires to attend medical school. When the family eventually buys a house in an all-white suburb, they are confronted with the polite racism of their new neighbors. </i></p>
<p><br />April 21 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Carrie</span>
<br />William Wyler, 1952 118m<p>
Theodore Dreiser's classic novel </SPAN><i>Sister Carrie</i> gets lavish and insightful treatment by one of the finest directors of the studio era. Carrie (Jennifer Jones), a small town girl, comes to Chicago dreaming of adventure and romance, only to find the realities of factory work and rooming with her sister's family both demoralizing and stifling. Carrie attracts the eye of George Hurstwood (Laurence Olivier), a cultured and successful restaurant manager. Blind to each other's circumstances--she is unaware he is married, and he assumes she is accustomed to a life of luxury--the two embark on a reckless affair that threatens to ruin them both.</i></p>
<p><br />April 28 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Medium Cool</span>
<br />Haskell Wexler, 1969 110m<p>
Filmed on location in and around Grant Park during the protests and skirmishes between students and Mayor Daley's police outside the Democratic National Convention in 1968, director and renowned cinematographer Wexler (<i>Days of Heaven</i>, <i>Matewan</i>) produces an incredible fusion of fiction and documentary. Television reporter John Cassellis (Robert Forster) moves through his reporting assignments with supreme personal detachment. But John meets a group of African American activists who inform him that the F.B.I. has used his footage to identify and arrest activists. Cassellis must confront his part in the media establishment. <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />May 5 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Cooley High</span>
<br />Michael Schultz, 1975 107m<p>
Set in Chicago in the 1960s, high school seniors Cochise (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs), a basketball star, and his best friend Preach (Glynn Turman), an aspiring poet, dream about a better future, but that doesn't stop them from enjoying the present. When they take a joyride in what turns out to be a stolen car, however, their carefree ways might turn out to have serious consequences. The film features a Motown soundtrack and wonderful performances from Hilton-Jacobs and Turman. Screenwriter Eric Monte attended the Edwin G. Cooley Vocational High School, which inspired the title, and grew up in the nearby Cabrini-Green housing project.   <i>35mm </i>
<p><br />May 12 7:00<br />
<span class="title">The Blues Brothers</span>
<br />John Landis, 1980 133m<p>
After Ellwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) picks up his brother Jake (John Belushi) from Joliet prison, the two revisit the orphanage where they grew up, only to discover that it is being sold by the board of education. Divinely inspired, the pair decide to raise the $5000 back taxes owed to the Cook County Assessor's Office by reuniting their old band to play a series of shows. The two experience a hilarious array of forces preventing them from achieving "their mission from God," including neo-Nazis, cop chases, and Jake's angry and heavily-armed ex-fianc&eacute;e Camille (Carrie Fisher). Watch for  performances by R&amp;B greats such as Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles. <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />May 19 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Sixteen Candles</span>
<br />John Hughes, 1984 93m<p>
Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) expects her sixteenth birthday to change things. Sadly, she awakes to find her  family is too preoccupied with her sister's upcoming wedding to remember the big day. Even worse, the school geek (Anthony Michael Hall) has a crush on her, she has to bring the foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong to the school dance, and the boy she really wants doesn't even know who she is. Shot at the old East Niles High School in Skokie, <i>Sixteen Candles</i> reveals an incredible grasp of the anxieties, sensibilities, and linguistic styles of teen culture, and features some of the first screen performances of local actors like Joan and John Cusack. <i>35mm</i>
<p><br />May 26 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Hoop Dreams</span>
<br />Steve James, 1994 170m<p>
Shot over five years, <i>Hoop Dreams</i> follows high school basketball players Arthur Agee and William Gates as they pursue their dreams to attend college on basketball scholarships and possibly play in the NBA. Recruited from West Side playgrounds to play at the prestigious St. Joseph's High School in the Chicago suburbs, William and Arthur find themselves in the midst of unexpected athletic and academic pressures. The film draws an often stark portrait of school politics, the alienating recruitment process, and the challenges of living in poverty. At the same time, it also details the support systems available in the communities and  families of the characters.  <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />June 2 7:00<br />
<span class="title">High Fidelity</span>
<br />Stephen Frears, 2000 113m<p>
<DIV class="DIVblurb-text">
			<SPAN class="dynamic-style-33">Rob (John Cusack) owns the semi-failing Wicker Park record shop Championship <BR></i>Vinyl, in which he, Dick, and Barry (Jack Black) spend their days talking pop culture and proving their passion for music. Rob's extended adolescence gets a jolt when his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle), despairing about the lack of progress in their relationship, leaves him for the guy upstairs (a long-haired Tim Robbins). Trying to figure out what went wrong, Rob revisits a series of old girlfriends. Nick Hornby's best selling novel comes to the screen with a taste of the realistic complexity that is the modern relationship,  comic relief, and some pretty sweet tunes.   <i>35mm</i></p>

<br /><a name="pandp"></a><span class="series">Tuesdays: Powell & Pressburger</span><br /><br />
April 1 7:00<br /><span class="title">An Airman's Letter to His Mother</span>
<br />Michael Powell, 1941 5m<p>
<span class="title">The Edge of the World</SPAN><SPAN class="dynamic-style-12"></span>
<br />Michael Powell, 1937 81m<p>
<i>Restored Print.</i> In an era of modernization, the population of the tiny and isolated Shetland island of Hirta faces the options of staying and struggling to maintain tradition, or asking for evacuation to the Scottish mainland. The choice drives families and generations apart, and leads to a terrifying competitive race up Hirta's fiercest cliff, as was the tradition. Powell's choice of subject and location shooting on the barren, rocky island for this his first feature displays the lyrical visuality he would bring to The Archers, his partnership with Hungarian Emeric Pressburger. <i>35mm</i></p>

<p><br />April 8 7:00<br />
<span class="title">49th Parallel</SPAN><SPAN class="dynamic-style-12"></span>
<br />Michael Powell, 1941 123m<p>
<i>New Print.</i> Writer Pressburger's gift for narrative structure drives <i>49th Parallel</i>, in which a renegade U-Boat crew dashes across Canada hoping to reach the still-neutral U.S. The Germans (including Eric Portman and Niall MacGinnis) encounter suitably eccentric Canadians along the way, including a French-Canadian fur-trapper (Laurence Olivier) and an intellectual Englishman (Leslie Howard).  Forced into a running debate on the relative merits of democracy versus totalitarianism, the brutal Germans draw ever closer to the longest unguarded frontier in the world. Famed composer Ralph Vaughn Williams provides the first score of his career.       <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />April 15 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</SPAN><SPAN class="dynamic-style-29"></span>
<br />Powell &amp; Pressburger, 1943 163m<p>
Clive Wynne-Candy (Roger Livesey) provides the basis for this exploration of the English psyche through the career of an officer in the British Army. Candy has become a "Colonel Blimp," an old General entrenched in the ways of the past. The narrative traces the origins of his mentality to his youth and the impudent insult that resulted in a duel with a German he had never met (Anton Walbrook). The duel resulted in a life-long friendship despite the fact that the German married Candy's love (Deborah Kerr). Though a heart-felt portrayal of British mentality, Winston Churchill tried to block it as detrimental to the war effort. <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />April 22 7:00<br />
<span class="title">A Canterbury Tale</span>
<br />Powell &amp; Pressburger, 1944 124m<p>
<i>New Print</i>. Now regarded as one of P&amp;P's finest achievements, this mystical tale focuses on three modern travelers who arrive in a small farming village on the medieval Pilgrim's Road to Canterbury. The three (a London girl out to learn farming to help the war, an American sergeant, and a British tank man) become involved in the investigation of a local prankster, and become acquainted with the local landed gentryman, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman). Colpeper tries to instill his love of the English countryside and heritage to British troops stationed nearby, in the very shadow of the great Canterbury Cathedral, to which all four make modern pilgrimages.  <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />April 29 7:00<br />
<span class="title">I Know Where I'm Going!</span>
<br />Powell &amp; Pressburger, 1945 92m<p>
<i>New Print.</i> Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller), a determined young woman, follows her industrial-magnate fianc&eacute;'s itinerary to the Isle of Kiloran in Scotland, where the two are to be married. But when dense fog followed by a gale disrupt the itinerary, Joan finds herself delayed with the charming Torquil MacNeil (Roger Livesey), on leave from the Navy. Scots tradition, eccentric falconry, an ancient curse, a ceilidh, and the treacherous Corryvreckan combine in this lovely romance with the rugged natural elements of Powell's earlier <i>The Edge of the World</i> and the sophisticated structure and lyricism of <i>A Canterbury Tale</i> to produce a thoroughly unusual and wonderfully engaging film. <i>35mm</i></p>

<p><br />May 6 7:00<br />
<span class="title">A Matter of Life and Death</span>
<br />Powell &amp; Pressburger, 1946 104m<p>
Peter (David Niven) radios his last bravura  words to an American radio operator before jumping out of his flaming bomber without a parachute. June (Kim Hunter), the radio operator, finds him on the beach --alive--and the two fall in love. But Peter is called up to Heaven by an angel (of sorts). He appeals the summons, and June enlists neurosurgeon Frank to help him. A court in Heaven convenes with a Revolutionary War patriot prosecuting and Frank defending Peter. P&amp;P used bold photography (monochromatic in Heaven, Technicolor on Earth), set design (including a stairway to Heaven) and direction. Released in the US as <i>Stairway to Heaven </i>despite Powell's objections<i>35mm</i>
<p><br />May 13  7:00<br />
<span class="title">Black Narcissus</span>
<br />Powell &amp; Pressburger, 1947 100m<p>
<i>New Print</i>. Cinematographer Jack Cardiff cited Vermeer and Rembrandt as influences, and with Alfred Junge's imaginative sets and Powell's visual direction, the painterly quality of <i>Black Narcissus </i>comes alive. Set high in a magnificently stylized conception of the Himalayas, five Anglican nuns, headed by Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr), establish a mission in the former "House of Women" of the local potentate. The thin air, the wind, the erotic wall paintings, the local wise man above them, the locals in the valley below, and the potentate's cynical, worldly, and painfully attractive representative (David Ferrar) test the commitment, vows, and very sanity of the cloistered nuns.
<p><br />May 20 7:00<br />
<span class="title">The Red Shoes</span>
<br />Powell &amp; Pressburger, 1948 133m<p>
<i>New Print.</i> The Lermontov Company, the most respected ballet troupe in the world, plans a production based on the Hans Christian Anderson story in which a dancer's shoes compel her to dance until her death. The director, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), works his new recruit Vicky (Moira Shearer) without rest, demanding that her life be subsumed to her art. But Vicky falls in love with the young composer Julian. Vicky's off-stage conflict mirrors the production, presented as a 14-minute segment unrivaled in cinema history. Powell's fascination with film and music combine with Jack Cardiff's cinematogarphy to create an expressionist masterpiece. <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />May 27 7:00<br /><span class="title">The Battle of the River Plate</span>
<br />Powell &amp; Pressburger, 1956 119m<p>
<i>New Print.</i> Having forged their working relationship during World War II, P&amp;P returned to the war for their last two collaborations. Unlike the heady mysticism of earlier works like <i>Black Narcissus</i>, <i>River Plate </i>remains strictly grounded, with a documentary feel and an outstanding cast including Anthony Quale and Michael Goodliffe. The 1939 battle (about which Powell wrote a book) saw the pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, pride of the German Navy, hounded into the neutral port of Montevideo by a squadron of smaller British ships. The time Graf Spee could spend in neutrality was limited, and the Royal Navy stalwartly awaited her re-engagement.  <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />June 3 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Ill Met by Moonlight</span>
<br />Powell &amp; Pressburger, 1957 104m<p>
<i>New Print.</i> Like<i> The Battle of the River Plate,</i> <i>Ill Met by Moonlight </i>comes from an historical event in the Second World War. On occupied Crete, a daring plan to kidnap the German commander, General Karl Kreipe (Marius Goring), falls to British Special Forces and the local resistance. Major Paddy Leigh-Fermor (Dirk Bogarde) and Captain Billy Moss (David Oxley) undertake the mission, capturing the German general's car and fleeing the pursuing Germans to their rendezvous with a British warship. The appreciation of landscape shown in <i>49th Parallel</i> returns, in addition to the suspense, wonderfully dark mood and energetic score by composer Mikis Theodorakis. <i>35mm</i>

<br /><br /><a name="drugs"></a><span class="series">Wednesdays: Uppers and Downers</span><br /><br />
April 2 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Easy Rider</span>
<br />Dennis Hopper, 1969 94m<p>
Peter Fonda is long-haired, motorcycle-riding, dope-smoking Wyatt "Captain America" Earp. He and his buddy Billy (Dennis Hopper) get a gig to drive a large stash of dope cross-country. But such work won't keep them from enjoying the finer things in life, like Mardi Gras, hippie girls, and rock and roll. When they meet up with alcoholic, ACLU lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson), the drawling, Southern attorney is so taken by their freedom-loving ways that he joins them on their odyssey, dreaming of whorehouses in New Orleans. When things take a violent turn, the rebellious, anti-establishment world of the young men crumbles. <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />April 9 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Up in Smoke</span>
<br />L. Adler &amp; T. Chong, 1978  86m<p>
Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong make their ensemble debut as Pedro de Pacas, a lower class Mexican-American  and Man Stoner, the ne'er-do-well son of rich, suburban, white bread parents, in this campy cult classic. The dynamic duo meet up by chance on the highway when Pedro is surfing for chicks and mistakes Mr. Stoner for a real looker. They instantly hit it off as fellow musicians and stoners and set off in search of some Maui Waui smoke. One deportation and jailbreak later, the two race across the border in a van made of weed with the cops hot on their trail. The quintessential feel good weed flick, <i>Up in Smoke</i> will have you rolling in the aisles.</p>
<p><br />April 16 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Basketball Diaries</SPAN><SPAN class="dynamic-style-30"></span>
<br />Scott Kalvert, 1995 102m</SPAN><SPAN class="dynamic-style-31"><p>
Based on poet Jim Carroll's cult book, <i>Basketball Diaries</i> is an autobiographical account of a high school basketball star's rapid descent into heroin addiction. After being expelled for using drugs before a game, Jim (Leonardo DiCaprio) soon finds himself isolated on the streets of New York, stealing and prostituting himself in order to feed his addiction. He is rescued by an older player only after having done irreparable damage to his family and friends. With strong supporting performances by Juliette Lewis and Lorraine Bracco, <i>Basketball Diaries</i> is an honest, heartfelt story that explores the gritty, devastating side of an often glamorized heroin addiction.  <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />April 23 7:00<br /><span class="title">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</span>
<br />Terry Gilliam, 1998 118m<p>
Terry Gilliam (<i>12 Monkeys, Brazil</i>) brings to life the infamous Hunter S. Thompson's account of "gonzo journalism." Roving reporter Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp, cigarette holder clenched in teeth, typewriter clasped to chest) and his Samoan sidekick, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), hit the road with a smorgasbord of drugs in their trunk and bloodstreams. They head straight for the DEA convention in Las Vegas, armed with blotter acid, amyls, cocaine, and mescaline. Vegas lounge lizards sprout scaly tails, bats flood the sky, hotel rooms transform into war zones, and Tobey Maguire gives a fantastic cameo appearance in this impressive showcase of Gilliam's trademark visual style. <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />April 30 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Requiem for a Dream</span>
<br />Darren Aronofsky, 2000 102m<p>
Aronofsky, who frightened and dazzled viewers with his combination of math and mysticism in his debut, &pi;, delves here into the warped territories of addiction, love, and drugs. Jared Leto delivers an intense performance as the idealistic Harry Goldfarb, overcome by the glamour and allure of heroin. Harry and Marion (Jennifer Connelly) exit the playful mischief of Brighton Beach and enter the dark world of chemical desperation. Their groundbreaking performances together with Aronofsky's trademark editing create a film so visually powerful that you feel the effects of this movie long after the credits roll.    <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />May 7 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Trainspotting</span>
<br />Danny Boyle, 1996 94m<p>
One of England's biggest hits (at least before all this Harry Potter nonsense came about), <i>Trainspotting</i> takes you on a hilarious fast-paced romp through the Edinburgh junkie scene. With its soft, saturated colors and gentle surrealism, it's almost as though you are seeing the film through the haze of a heroin high. Although wrought with violence, the scatological horrors of heroin addiction, AIDS deaths, and infant neglect (this one is not for the squeamish), <i>Trainspotting</i> still manages to get across the tender and desperate camaraderie of young Scottish hooligans (Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle among them) with little to do in their lives. <i>35mm</i></p>
<p><br />May 14 7:00<br />
<span class="title">Traffic</span>
<br />Steven Soderbergh, 2000 147m<p>
In this top-to-bottom look at the drug business in the U.S., director Soderbergh focuses on three compelling and complicated inter-locked stories. The new Drug Czar (Michael Douglas), discovers his own family is beset by the specter of adolescent addiction. A society wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) reacts to the destruction of her world when her husband is arrested for trafficking. A police officer on the streets of Tijuana (Benicio Del Toro) grapples with the immorality and practical necessity of the drug trade. Astonishing in its realism, <i>Traffic</i> is an intelligent and conscientious investigation of the money, the power, the causes, and the consequences of the business of narcotics and the War on Drugs. <i>35mm</i></p>

<span class="title">Go</span>
<br />Doug Liman, 1999 103m<p>
A follow up to Liman's <i>Swingers,</i> this is a Christmas story for ravers. The cameras are fast and the beats are furious as Liman takes us through the high-energy underground L.A. scene, crammed with addicts, con-men, mobsters, dealers, and other low-lifes. Combined with its circular plot, <i>Go</i>'s flashy sequences and techno-laden soundtrack lead to a frenetically exciting movie that goes a long way toward recreating the clubbing experience on screen, including a drug-induced Macarena and a talking cat. Sarah Polley (<i>The Sweet Hereafter</i>), Katie Holmes ("Dawson's Creek"), and Taye Diggs (<i>Chicago</i>, <i>The Wood</i>) turn out hip, lively, and comedic performances. <i>35mm</i></p>

After a trip to Mexico to visit a tribe of Indians who use a peyote-type substance in rituals, Eddie begins to use the drug alongside his sensory deprivation experiments with some scary, dazzling, and enlightening results.  Adapted from the novel by Paddy Chayefsky who was inspired by the experiments of Dr. John Lily in the 1970s, Chayefsky asked that his name be taken off of the credits because of maverick director Russell's intense, metaphysically-charged twist at the end.  </i></p>

The Virginian (Gary Cooper) is a cowboy who is tough but tender. When Molly Wood comes to town, he and his best friend Steve fight over her, tearing the friends apart. Alongside this love triangle, however, is a classic Wild West debacle. Soon after joining a band of cattle rustlers, Steve is brought to justice, andthe Virginian must oversee his hanging.

"I knew Wyatt Earp... and he told me about the fight at the OK Corral. So we did it exactly the way it had been," John Ford once said. However, Ford's films were never 'exactly like' anything else. The famed director knew the mythology of the West he created, usually without a specific historical reference. Here, the reference is the famous showdown between the lawless Clanton brood and Tombstone's lawman, Wyatt Earp (Henry Fonda), his brothers Morgan and Virgil, and their compatriot, the earthy Doc Holliday (Victor Mature). <i>35mm</i></p>

Dubbed by some as the "essence of American action cinema," <i>Forty Guns</i> stars the lovely Barbara Stanwyck as a sensual autocrat who uses a posse of gunmen to rule Arizona county. Though this near legendary B Western has often been called a Freudian Western because of its strange sexual nature, even Freud would have trouble with dreams as vivid and raw as Fuller's.With a daring and darting camera style, Fuller creates his own brand of western, adding in a little extra pulp.               <i>35mm</i></p>

<br />Tim Burton, 1985 90m<p>
Before Chairry, Globey, Floory, and the word of the day, Pee-wee's zaininess and refusal to grow up was on the big screen. When his one-of-a-kind bike is stolen, Pee-wee (Paul Reubens) is forced to hunt it down, leading him across the country, encountering a variety of crazy characters. Pee-wee revolutionized comedy for a whole generation of children, and his works have yet to age.

Ed Wood, who made earnest attempts to create works of critical import, has insteadreceived recognition as having created some of the worst movies of all time. </i>With a wonderful performance by Martin Landau (<i>North by Northwest</i>)  as the horror legend Bela Lugosi, Burton's biopic outdoes anything ever created by Ed Wood.  <i>35mm</i></p>

<span class="title">Living in Oblivion</span>
<br />Tom DiCillo, 1995 90m<p>
<i>Living in Oblivion</i> is a hilarious look inside independent filmaking. Nick Reves (Steve Buscemi) is an eager filmaker with a neurotic cast who can't seem to get it together. Indie superstar Catherine Keener is an actress who can't escape her Richard Gere shower scene past, and James LeGros is set to star in a film where he plays "a sort of sexy serial killer who shacks up with Winona Ryder." Filmed in alternating black and white and color, this film is much more than just an exercise in meta-filmmaking.

Adam Sandler (<i>Punch-Drunk Love</i>) is charming as Robbie Hart, a down-and-out wedding singer just dumped by his girlfriend. Things look better when he meets waitress Julia (Drew Barymore). Though not the lead, Steve Buscemi still manages to steal this show. The film captures its mid-eighties setting with just enough hokiness to make it authentic, without being ridiculous. Featuring a fun soundtrack, a rapping grandma, and the always sexy Billy Idol, this is all-around good fun.   <i>35mm</i></p>

Buscemi finally gets to woo the girl in this story adapted from Daniel Clowe's graphic novel by the same name. Playing Seymour, a record collector who "can't relate to 99% of humanity," Buscemi returns to the lonely man character he often portrays. Although the film presents an alienating view of the world, you learn that even the most hopeless characters can find themselves. Nominated for a best adapted screenplay Oscar, the script is full of caustic one liners that are as funny as they are sad.

FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is hot on the trail of high school prankster Frank Abagnale, Jr. (the ever-pubescent Leonardo DiCaprio) in this glossy 1960s yarn. The teenage upstart has been gallivanting about the globe, posing as lawyers, doctors, and airline pilots; cashing fake Pan-Am checks, and romancin' the ladies, all to Mr. Hanratty's chagrin.  Was it Frank's father (the sometimes soft shoeing, always creepy, Christopher Walken)'s heartbreak that led to our troubled young protagonist's antics? Is it all a cry for help? Who knows? DiCaprio's quick-witted wheedling and slippery impersonations make him a thoroughly enjoyable scamp to watch.  </p>

He is going to prison on drug charges the next day, his father is constantly in debt, his old friends have grown distant and cynical, he suspects that his girlfriend turned him in, and the mob is on his back.  With these few minutes full of the most impassioned and vitriolic language, Montgomery's frustration with a seemingly wasted life and his true love of the city and all its people becomes poignantly clear. This is Spike Lee's first film since September 11th, and his reaction to it is moving and gritty.     <i>35mm</i></p>

Ray Liotta, larger than ever, stars as Henry Oak, a cop investigating his partner's murder. The department recruits Nick Tellis (Jason Patric), a former undercover narc recovering from a heroin addiction acquired in the line of duty, to take over the investigation.

Schmidt sets out in his 35-foot Winnebago for Denver to meet his daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) and her new in-laws.  What follows is a satirical and poetic account of Schmidt's trip.   With an unsentimental realism,  Alexander Payne (<i>Election</i>) shows us the story of an ordinary life examined for the first time.

When three sisters are sent to a settlement over 1500 miles away from their home, fourteen-year-old Molly leads their escape through the stunning Australian landscape. The only way to find home is to follow the world's longest rabbit-proof fence. Based on a true story, the film details an appalling Australian policy that took place until 1970. However, the film remains inspirational as it follows the journey of the dedicated girls, their family, and the country as a whole.  <i>35mm</i></p>

From director Atom Egoyan (<i>The Sweet Hereafter</i>), <i>Ararat</i> examines the production of a Hollywood-style film (<i>Ararat</i>) about the genocide of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey between 1915 and 1918. After casting  half-Turkish Ali, the director enlists art historian Ani when he and his scriptwriter discover that painter Arshile Gorky (her specialty) survived the genocide. Her son Raffi and his examination by a Canadian customs officer provide the narrative locus of the film's structure, while Raffi's words, <i>Ararat</i>'s script, Gorky's painting, and Ali's powerfully dismissive comments focus on the relevance of memory and the ephemeral nature of Truth.   <i>35mm</i></p>

But after Cathy discovers her husband (Dennis Quaid)'s homosexuality, she finds that the only person who understands her is the family's black gardener, Raymond (Dennis Haysbert).  Cathy's perfect existence is threatened, and this tale of forbidden love explores the dark undertones of race and homosexuality that belie the idealistic appearance of her world. Director Todd Haynes simultaneously pays tribute to the 1950s melodramas of Douglas Sirk while criticizing the social repression of the era. <i>35mm</i></p>

The vibrant and brutal tales of extreme poverty, street gangs, and drug lords are brought into focus by the young Rocket, whose stories about L'il Dice, the child murderer who would become drug lord, Benny, and "Knockout Ned" deftly illustrate the development of <i>Cidade De Deus</i> from an urban wasteland in the 1960s to a gang-ruled hellhole in the 1980s.

The real "Stanford Prison Experiment" that inspired the film closed for the same reasons after only six days, but <i>Das Experiment</i> allows man's inhumanity toward man and his love of power to continue. <i>35mm</i></p>

<br />Stephen Daldry, 2002 114m<p>
Adapted from Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer-winning novel, this movie tells the story of three women:  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) and Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep). They are outwardly strong women who do not back down from the sad, cruel world and their difficult lives.  But deep down, each woman is alone and longing for romance--just like Mrs. Dalloway, the main character of the novel Virginia is writing.  Clarissa just so happens to be reading this same novel, while Laura is virtually living it out. A meditation about lives governed by responsibilities and guilt, dealing with sickness, sexuality, and death. <i>35mm</i></p>

<span class="title">The Quiet American</span>
<br />Phillip Noyce, 2002 118m<p>
In this film adaptation of Graham Greene's 1955 novel, the personal and political become inexorably intertwined in Vietnam a decade before America's official, publicly acknowledged involvement. Vietnam was a European colony before World War II, and it is through the eyes of ageing European journalist Fowler (Michael Caine), doggedly holding on to his Vietnam and his Vietnamese mistress, that the story unfolds. The young and idealistic best-and-the-brightest humanitarian Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) arrives, and offers to replace European colonialism with boxes of American supplies and advice, and to replace Fowler in Phong's life.<i>35mm</i></p>

<span class="title">The Pianist</span>
<br />Roman Polanski, 2002 148m<p>
Based on the memoirs of the talented Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, <i>The Pianist</i> follows Szpilman (Adrien Brody) as anti-Semitism grows more rampant throughout Poland in the 1930s.  Szpilman uses his fame and talent to survive as the situation worsens. Brody's performance brilliantly plays out the physical and mental disintegration from a cool, smirking dandy to a sickly, animal-like figure. Roman Polanski's attempt at objectivity in portraying the plight of Jews in Nazi Europe ultimately speaks volumes. The presentation of good and bad Jews and Nazis lofts this story of the Holocaust even above the level of <i>Schindler's List</i>. <i>35mm</i></p>

<br />Eugene Jarecki, 2002 80m<p>
There are many who now decry his geopolitical activities, but he never faced trial for any crimes against humanity. He is Henry Kissinger, the former Harvard professor and Richard Nixon's Secretary of State. He is the subject of this documentary focusing on Christopher Hitchen's book accusing Kissinger of war crimes regarding United States official and covert policy in Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, and Indonesia. <i>The Trials of Henry Kissinger</i> provokes interesting questions regarding the responsibility of political leaders in the 20th century, when complicated international relations leave difficult questions of responsibility, especially personal responsibility. <i>35mm</i></p>

<span class="title">Amandla!</span>
<br />Lee Hirsch, 2002 108m<p>
Winner of both the Sundance Documentary Audience Award and Freedom of Expression Award, <i>Amandla! </i>is a celebration of the revolutionary freedom songs of South Africa. Combining live archive footage and intimate interviews, this documentary focuses on musicians and activists like Hugh  Masekela and Thandi Modise in the context of the freedom movement in the '60s and '70s. Filled with beautifully vivid sequences of song and dance, <i>Amandla!</i>  bursts with the energy of a people who used song as their main weapon in the fight against apartheid. As funny as it is powerful, this  amazing film is not to be missed. <i>35mm</i></p>
