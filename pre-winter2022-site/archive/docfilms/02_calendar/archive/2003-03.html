In Frenzy, Richard Blaney is framed for murder afterhaving unwittingly been taken in by the psychopathic "Necktie Murderer"Robert Rusk. While Blaney flees for his very life, Chief Inspector Oxford ofScotland Yard pursues him relentlessly, but only when not suffering the culinaryabuses of his wife.</p><p>July 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Strangers on a Train</span><br />Alfred Hitchcock, 1951 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 101m<p>Be careful what you wish for, and be careful who you share yourwishes with. Tennis champion Guy Haines (Farley Granger) wishes to divorce hispromiscuous wife to remarry. On the train to his fianc&eacute;e's home, he meetsBruno Anthony (Robert Walker), who wants his father dead. They agree to killeach other's obstacles to happiness, but Bruno doesn't get the joke. Soonafter, Guy's wife is murdered, and Bruno's intrusions into Guy's life become evermore terrifying. &nbsp;<p>July 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">The Birds</span><br />Alfred Hitchcock, 1963 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 119m<p>A film that Hitchcock himself proclaimed as one of his "scariest,"The Birds has been making pet owners look at their animals in a slightlydifferent way for 40 years. Socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) drives tothe small coastal village of Bodega Bay in an innocent attempt to deliver apair of love birds. But shortly after she arrives, the area birds beginexhibiting odd behavior. Soon after, nature takes hold and the birds beginsavagely attacking local townspeople. Beware: after watching, you may never enter aphone booth again.<p>July 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Knife in the Water</span><br />Roman Polanski, 1962 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 94m<p>The complex psychology between a successful bourgeois, his wife,and the young stranger they run into on holiday provide the tension and suspensein this unpredictable and atmospheric thriller from Polanski, at theheight of his Polish cinema fame. The self-confidant Andrzej convinces astranger to go sailing after almost hitting him with his car. On the boat,Andrzej relentlessly provokes him, despite warning signs that the strangeris not harmless.</p><p>July 23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Repulsion</span><br />Roman Polanski, 1965 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 104m<p>Though Polanski's first film in English, this creepy thriller seessome of its best moments in silence, as the camera voyeuristically followsCatherine Deneuve around her solitary London flat. As loneliness and sexual frustration set in, the young girl slowly, quietly goes insane.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Polanski, who later directed Rosemary's Baby, recreates her horrid nightmares withuneasy, surrealistic images, including some of the weirdest walls you'll ever see.<p>July 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Cul-de-Sac</span><br />Roman Polanski, 1966 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 111m<p>A castle just off the English coast provides a suitable hidingplace for two criminals on the run. But inside this castle, things are far fromnormal. The castle's inhabitants are not the type one would expect to findjust off England. &nbsp;George (Donald Pleasence) has a most unusualrelationship with his French wife Teresa (Fran&ccedil;oise Dorl&eacute;ac), and the weirdness spreadsto the relationship between the two unwilling hosts and their criminalgatecrashers.<p>August 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Juve vs. Fant&ocirc;mas</span><br />Louis Feuillade, 1913  64m<p>One chapter and one complete tale from director Feuillade'smagnificent and ground-breaking "Fant&ocirc;mas" serial. The S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, represented by theresourceful Inspector Juve, are out to stop the nefarious Fant&ocirc;mas, a thiefwith a penchant for disguise and a dangerous animus. Their meeting features notonly the Holmes-and-Moriarty style mental duels, intrigues, and twists, butalso include a touch of fantasy and magic. This was mostly shot on location in and around Paris.<p>August 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  8:00<br /><span class="title">Menilmontat</span><br />DiMitri Kirsanov, 1924 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25m<p>A beautiful and moving film on the subject of love and violence inParis, and how it affects two orphaned sisters.<p><span class="title">The Blood of a Poet</span><br />Jean Cocteau, 1932 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   55m<p>This the first in Cocteau's experimental "Orphic Trilogy" followsa poet through a series of dream-like occurences wrought with surrealistimagery and symbolism. The poet starts sketching faces, but when one comesalive he launches into an exploration of the potential of film to obscurereality.<p>August 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  8:00<br /><span class="title">Eyes Without A Face</span><br />Georges Franju, 1959 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 88m<p>Far from prying eyes, in a chateau in the French woods, lives asurgeon (Pierre Brasseur), his mistress (Alida Valli) and his daughter. Due to anautomobile accident with her father, the little girl has only eyes and noface under the blank mask she wears. Desperate to correct his wrong, the fathersends his mistress to the countryside to procure face after face for thegirl. All transplants have failed so far, leaving only faceless victims andincreasing madness in their wake.</p><p>August 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  8:00<br /><span class="title">Day of Wrath</span><br />Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1943 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 110m<p>Dreyer often centered his narratives on religion, and often on thepersecution and ostracism of individuals. Like his masterful The Passion ofJoan of Arc, Day of Wrath concerns historical persecution by the church forwitchcraft, this time in 17th Century Denmark. The accusations of trafficking withthe Devil are first flung at an old woman, but after the death of the townpastor, his mother accuses the pastor's young wife of the same, and demands justice.<p><br /><a name="thur"></a><span class="series">Thursdays</span><p>June 26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">La Symphonie Pastorale</span><br />Jean Delannoy, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 110m<p>Author Andr&eacute; Gide had suffered greatly both from the loss of hiswife in 1938 and the French defeat in 1940, with France's internalre-organization in conflict with his humanist ideology. Gide's novel, La SymphoniePastoral, seemed perfect for a France struggling to rationalize its wartimeactions. A blind woman (Mich&egrave;le Morgan) is taken in by a man of the church,entagling her in an unexpected and disturbing relationship with the minister,his son, and her eventual sight.<p>July 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">The Adventures of Robin Hood</span><br />Michael Curtiz, 1938 &nbsp; 102m<p>Errol Flynn is Robin Hood, swinging from trees to rob the rich andgive to the poor. While tangling with bad Prince John (Claude Rains) andGisbourne (Basil Rathbone), he maintains his charm, wit, and bright smile for MaidMarian (Olivia de Havilland). Director Curtiz used the magnificent flairof Warner's at their swashbuckling height, shot in luminous Technicolor, andErich Wolfgang Korngold provided the score, creating this most wonderful tale.<p>July 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Diabolique</span><br />Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1955 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 88m<p>This mature drama follows the actions of the wife and mistress ofa sadistic school headmaster as they plot his murder. They decide to drownhim and dump his body in a pool, but when the body disappears and sightings ofthe headmaster are reported, the two women find themselves entangledin an impossible mystery far beyond simple murder. Clouzot's Diaboliqueis a masterful study of pure suspense that is guaranteed to have yourheart pounding.</p><p>July 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Dressed to Kill</span><br />Roy William Neill, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 72m<p>Holmes set the standard for detective fiction with his coldlyrational reasoning powers despite being the creation of Sir Arthur ConanDoyle; country doctor, author of "The Lost World," and subscriber to theories ofastral projection. Though a good Peircian semiotician may quarrel withthe famous "deductive reasoning," the solution remains elementary to thegreat detective. In this installment of the cases of Holmes, he and Watson comeacross a series of random unrelated murders and must discover the sinister motivebehind them!<p>July 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">The Sound Barrier</span><br />David Lean, 1952 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 111m<p>David Lean pays homage to the frontiersmen of British aerospace inthe jet age, while exploring the psychology he would later develop in Lawrenceof Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai. The film focuses on a test pilot, hismarriage to Susan Ridgefield (Ann Todd),the risky life of her brotherChristopher and an aircraft firm headed by their father, John Ridgefield (RalphRichardson). The stunning aerial photography and magisterial score accentuate thenarrative balancing act of scientific progress versus the lives of those onthe edge.<p>July 31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Glen or Glenda?</span><br />Ed Wood, 1953 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 67m<p>Ed Wood is heralded as the "world's worst filmmaker," and thisfilm journies to the depths and heights of his almost lyrical incompetence.&nbsp;Glen/Glenda is a troubled transvestite (Ed Wood) with a passion for angoraaccessories and a goal of surgical intervention. &nbsp;The film has a distinctlyhybrid character, combining a police investigation, hilarious melodramaticconfrontations, demonic S&amp;M dream sequences, and seemingly unmotivated insertsof stock footage.<p>August 7 &nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00<br /><span class="title">Putney Swope</span><br />Robert Downey, Sr., 1969 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 84m<p>Beginning the fine tradition of Blazing Saddles and TradingPlaces, Putney Swope makes the racial switcheroo comedy possible. Its release in1969 represented a true milestone: this was the sort of racial commentary Hollywood happily kept locked in the basement. A rich white corporate boardplots to pass power from one cracker to another. But the honkeys miscalculate,resulting in the ascendancy of the board's token brother, Putney Swope.Unsatisfied with the company's lack of color, Swope re-invents Wall Street with a taste for what's hip.<p>August 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  8:00<br /><span class="title">Destiny</span><br />Fritz Lang, 1921 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 110m<p>Lang's Destiny (originally Der M&uuml;de Tod, and known in English alsoas The Weary Death) combines an existential plot with the creative film-makingdesign that later would come to be called German Expressionism. Death hastaken a young man to the other side. Desperate to save her love's life, his fianc&eacute;e strikes a deal. She is transplanted into three different places anddifferent times charged with saving one life in exchange for that of her fianc&eacute;.<p>August 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  8:00<br /><span class="title">Cops</span><br />Keaton &amp; Cline, 1922 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18m<p><p><span class="title">The Paleface</span><br />Keaton &amp; Cline, 1922 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11m<p><p><span class="title">Seven Chances</span><br />Buster Keaton, 1925 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  56m<p>In Cops, Buster is chased by a lot of police, and in The Palefacehe finds himself paired with a victimized Native American tribe. Followingthese successes, Keaton made Seven Chances, the story of adown-on-his-luck bachelor who finds he will inherit a fortune, but only if he can find awife by the end of the day.<p>August 28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  8:00<br /><span class="title">World for Ransom</span><br />Robert Aldrich, 1954 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  82m<p>South Seas drifter Mike Callahan (Dan Duryea) came back from warto find his girlfriend, Frennessey, married to his friend Julian. Now, adecade later, Julian is working for Singapore's crime boss (Gene Lockhart). Frennesseyseeks Callahan's aid in investigating her hustband by promising to comeback to him. Callahan, unsure of his future but still in love, agrees. Unknownto him, the future of the world may rest on the points of this bitter lovetriangle.<p><br /><a name="fri"></a><span class="series">Fridays</span><br />June 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00,9:15<br /><span class="title">Fallen Angels</span><br />Wong Kar-wai, 1995   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96m<p>A hitman decides to give up his trade and leave his beautifulpartner in the lurch because she set him up (though they've never met).Meanwhile, a young, mute ex-con who lives with his dutiful father plies a number ofunusual trades in Hong Kong's nightstreets. Fallen Angels may feellike a more-polished remake of Wong's influential Chungking Express, but dig deeper andbe surprised at the depth of expression he weaves around his themes of isolation and loneliness.<p>July 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00,9:15<br /><span class="title">Happy Together</span><br />Wong Kar-wai, 1997  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 96m<p>A young gay couple, Yiu-Fai and Po-Wing have their share ofrelationship troubles. Believingthat starting anew in another country will solve their problems, they leave Hong Kong for Buenos Aires only to havedifficulties lead to separation. Yiu-Fai works long hours in order to return to Hong Kong, but Po-Wing's subsequent return to his life complicates matters evenfurther. Wong Kar-wai won a well-deserved Best Director award at Cannes for thisfilm.<p>July 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00,9:30<br /><span class="title">Damn Yankees!</span><br />G.

But Seymourproduces a giant, talking, man-eating plant that needs human flesh to survive. At first Seymour donates his own blood tofeed the plant, but it eventually convinces him to kill other people tofeed its ferocious appetite.<p>July 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00,9:00<br /><span class="title">Dude, Where's My Car?</span><br />Danny Leiner, 2000 &nbsp;&nbsp; 83m<p>After a night of debauchery, So-Cal stoners Jesse (Ashton Kutcher)and Chester (Seann William Scott) have forgotten where they parked theircar.

Catherine Deneuvestars as Genevi&egrave;ve, a young woman pursued by two men who both love herdearly. One is her husband, one the father of her child. Deneuve's performancehere, at age 20, catapulted her into cinema and began a career that would spanforty years.<p>August 8 &nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00,9:00<br /><span class="title">Duck Soup</span><br />Leo McCarey, 1933 &nbsp; 70m<p>In this classic, Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx), recently nameddictator of the tiny country of Fredonia, immediately begins launchinginsults. Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania (Louis Calhern), a constant target ofFirefly's wit, declares war over his hurt pride.

In this psychologically charged plainspicture, Vern Haskall (Arthur Kennedy of The Lusty Men and Lawrence of Arabia)vociferously trails a bandit who robbed, raped and killed his fianc&eacute;e. The onlylead he has is a dying man's words.

Although much attention waspaid to the film's depiction of Jesus' desire for a sexual relationship withMary Magdalene, the re-telling of Judas' story is alsonoteable.&nbsp;In effect, Judas becomes the hero, and his betrayal of Jesus proves central andnecessary to his Messianic mission.<p>August 9 &nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00,9:15<br /><span class="title">The Woman in White</span><br />Peter Godfrey, 1948&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 109m<p>Count Fosco (Sydney Greenstreet), urbane and debonair, has asubtle and cunning plan to destroy two young women, the beautiful but frail Laura andher friend and kindly relative, Marian.

Soon after,his wife disappears. Walker, initially perplexed, descends into the dark side of Paris. To Walker, an American ofgood standing, this is unfamiliar ground indeed, and Polanski uses his mastery ofthe unsettling to maximize the feeling of alienation and steadilyincreases the tension through every suspenseful, frantic moment of the film.</p><p>August 23  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00, 9:15<br /><span class="title">Blow-Up</span><br />Michelangelo Antonioni, 1966 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 111m<p>Image and reality combine in the swinging society of London's1960s.
