<H3><A name="monday" id="monday"></A>Mondays - A Conscious West / Decalogue</H3>

<P>Five westerns that deal with controversial and relevant social issues, followed by Kieslowski's
monumental cinematic adaptation of the Ten Commandments. </P>

Monday, March 27 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Unforgiven</STRONG><BR>
<I>John Huston, 1960 - 125m</I><BR>
John Huston's masterful western about race focuses on the Zacharys, a Southwest Cattle family:
mother Mathilda (Lilian Gish), sons Ben and Cash (Burt Lancaster and Audie Murphy), and daughter
Rachel (a radiant Audrey Hepburn in her only Western). The family lives an idyllic life until a
rumor circulates that Rachel is not a Zachary at all, but rather a Kiowa Indian. The once friendly
town folk grow increasingly hostile toward the Zachary clan as they learn the truth about the
rumor. <BR><BR>
<STRONG class="title">A meeting for individuals interested in volunteering at Doc will take place in the
cinema at 5:30 P.M. </STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

Monday, April 3 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Hombre</STRONG><BR>
<I>Martin Ritt, 1967 - 111m</I><BR>
Considered by some to be Paul Newman's greatest western (as well as being Elmore Leonard's first
novel to be converted to film), Hombre focuses on John Russell (Paul Newman), a white man raised by
Apaches, as he interacts with a stagecoach full of whites from various backgrounds and classes as 
they travel across Death Valley. Filled to the brim with a myriad of wonderful character 
actors -- Frederic March, Richard Boone, Martin Balsam, etc. -- Hombre handles the complexities of
race and class as well as any 
western ever made.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Monday, April 10 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">A Fistful of Dynamite</STRONG><BR>
<I>Sergio Leone, 1972 - 158m</I><BR>
Beginning with a quote from Chairman Mao ("The revolution is not a dinner party..."), Spaghetti master Sergio Leone takes the audience on a two hour ride with IRA agent John Mallory (James Coburn) and Mexican bandito/revolutionary Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) as they rob, kill, and demolish, all in the name of progress. Referred to by J.Hoberman of the Village Voice as  "a relentless exercise in class vengeance," FOD magnificently displays the dizzying landscape of 1960's revolutionary politics. (Original Italian title: <I>Giu la Testa</I>; alternate American title: <I>Duck, You Sucker!</I>)</BLOCKQUOTE>

Monday, April 17 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Blazing Saddles</STRONG><BR>
<I>Mel Brooks, 1974 - 93m</I><BR>
A Mel Brooks masterpiece, BS (gotta love a bad pun...) ingeniously deconstructs the Western genre, and along the way tackles race, gender, sexuality, big business and lederhosen. Although no plot description could do this film justice, the story includes all of the following, in rough chronological order: quicksand, lots of Johnsons, a boozy gunslinger, a Yiddish-speaking Indian chief, a tricky temptress, a mammoth subhuman named Mongo, cream pies and more. Setting up and breaking down all barriers, including the line between set and studio, <I>Blazing Saddles</I> is a true American classic.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Monday, April 24 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Heaven's Gate</STRONG><BR>
<I>Michael Cimino, 1980 - 219m</I><BR>
Michael Cimino's career-ending examination of the "civilizing" of the West by wealthy land grubbers. The film features strong performances from Christopher Walken, John Hurt, Isabella Huppert, Kris Kristofferson, and <I>Citizen Kane</I> alum Joseph Cotten in his final role. Although it is widely considered the biggest flop of 1980's big-budget Hollywood - Cimino even received a Golden Raspberry award for worst director - and perhaps because it's widely considered the biggest flop of 1980's big-budget Hollywood, <I>Heaven's Gate</I>, in its gargantuan glory, demands to be considered.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Monday, May 1 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Decalogue #1/#2</STRONG><BR>
<I>Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1989 - 55m/59m</I><BR>
In <I>I Am the Lord Thy God, Thou Shalt Have No Other God Before Me</I>, the dramatic opening episode of the Decalogue series, a scientist at a local University has faith in the rational explanations of science over a more spiritual path, but when his faith in science causes a family tragedy, he is forced to question his rational approach to life. In Episode Two, <I>Thou Shalt Not Take the Name of the Lord Thy God in Vain</I> a woman caught between her terminally ill husband and her lover wants an abortion for a child of unknown origin, and a doctor must decide how to handle the potential life of an unborn child.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Monday, May 8 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Decalogue #3/#4</STRONG><BR>
<I>Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1989 - 57m/57m</I><BR>
The Decalogue series begins to gain speed in Episode Three, <I>Honor the Sabbath Day</I>,  as a married father is commandeered on Christmas Eve by a former lover to look for her husband. The pursuit is as relevant to their affair as it is to their relationships with their spouses. In Episode Four, <I>Honor thy Father and Mother</I>, a young child treats her father as a close friend as well as a parent. But then she receives a letter from her mother that shatters her perception of her relationship with her father -- if he is her father at all.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Monday, May 15 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Decalogue #5/#6</STRONG><BR>
<I>Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1989 - 59m/60m</I><BR>
The peak of the Decalogue series, both episodes were extended into feature length films and lauded on the festival circuit upon their release. In Episode Five, <I>Thou Shalt Not Kill</I>, Kieslowski brings us the story of a deranged man who kills a taxi driver. The ensuing debate over his execution drives the most stunning installment in the entire series. Episode Six, <I>Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery</I>, concerns a young adult who regularly spies on an older female artist, and the surprising relationship they develop when they finally meet.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Monday, May 22 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Decalogue #7/#8</STRONG><BR>
<I>Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1989 - 57m/56m</I><BR>
The powerful mastery of Kieslowski continues in Episode Seven, <I>Thou Shalt Not Steal</I>, where an unstable mother kidnaps her daughter, but cannot deal with the consequences of her self-imposed commitment to motherhood. In Episode Eight, <I>Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness Against Thy Neighbor</I>, a researcher visits an ethics professor and identifies herself as a child the professor betrayed during the Second World War. The episode is an intense investigation of how the legacy of decisions made under turmoil follows us for the rest of our lives.</BLOCKQUOTE> 

Monday, May 29 - 6:45
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Decalogue #9/#10</STRONG><BR>
<I>Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1989 - 60m/59m</I><BR>
In Episode Nine, <I>Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Wife</I>, an impotent husband begs his wife to take a lover, then second-guesses himself and vows suicide, despite his wife's undying loyalty. The series concludes with <I>Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Goods</I>, a tale of two brothers who acquire a stamp collection upon their father's death. Their father's obsessive pursuit soon overtakes the brothers, and their mad drive for material ultimately becomes their downfall.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A name="tuesday" id="tuesday"></A>Tuesdays - Asian-American Cinema</H3>

<P>Trashing saccharine stereotypes, these ten new films come from Asian-American directors, many of whom will be joining us to speak at Doc!<BR>
Jointly funded by PanAsia.</P>

Tuesday, March 28 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Yellow</STRONG><BR>
<I>Chris Chan Lee, 1997 - 101m</I><BR>
Chris Chan Lee's debut film follows a group of L.A. teenagers on the night before their high school graduation. Sin Lee (what a name!) has to mind his father's grocery store, but, lucky for him, it gets robbed of $1500 at gunpoint. Sin tells his friends that his father won't let him go to college unless he gets the money back, and they rally together to scrape up the dough. First, they buy a vintage car, only to have it stolen. After a few more pathetic attempts, they end up broke by the end of the night. Sin runs away and in an act of desperation commits a crime that he may ultimately regret.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, April 4 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Saving Face</STRONG><BR>
<I>Alice Wu, 2002 - 91m</I><BR>
Wilhelma Pang is an overworked New York City surgeon and a dutiful daughter to Ma Peng. She appeases her mother by attending Chinese single dances at a school gym and tolerating the matchmaking of Ma Peng's elderly acquaintances. Unbeknownst to them, Wil goes against the perfect daughter image and enters a romance with gorgeous, but down-to-earth ballet dancer Vivian Liu. To add to her personal drama, Wil finds her mother on her doorstep, pregnant and ostracized by her traditional Chinese community. A lesbian daughter and a pregnant mother, both in clandestine relationships!</BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, April 11 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Kung Phooey!</STRONG><BR>
<I>Darryl Fong, 2004 - 87m</I><BR>
Oh no!!! Stolen years ago, Shur-Li Temple's Ancient Peach holds the secret to eternal youth. It must be returned! One of the more successful martial arts parodies to deal with crime bosses and stereotypes, <I>Kung Phooey!</I> brings to mind films like <I>Austin Powers</I>, <I>Airplane</I>, and <I>Naked Gun</I>. Includes Art Chew (a character, not a sneeze) and Roy Lee, a black kid who thinks he's the reincarnation of Jet Li. Also, watch for Steven Seagal eating fried chicken, as well as parodies of Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme.<BR><BR>
<STRONG class="title">Following the screening, Director Darryl Fong will be speaking in the cinema.</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, April 18 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Robot Stories</STRONG><BR>
<I>Greg Pak, 2004 - 85m</I><BR>
Robotic sentimentality: an oxymoron, or the essence of these four shorts? Likened to the stories of Ray Bradbury, <I>Robot Stories</I> is a quartet of robot-infused Valentine tales: My Robot Baby, The Robot Fixer, Machine Love, and Clay. <I>Robot Stories</I> depicts human characters struggling to connect in a world of robot babies, robot toys, android office workers, and digital immortality. Most poignant of the four shorts is The Robot Fixer, in which a grieving mother works to revive her comatose son by repairing his broken toys.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, April 25 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Mysterious Skin</STRONG><BR>
<I>Gregg Araki, 2004 - 90m</I><BR>
The latest of director Gregg Araki's films, <I>Mysterious Skin</I> offers a dramatic look at the traumatic effects of paedophilia. Araki focuses on the childhood experiences of two Midwestern boys who learn to grapple with their collective shame when they meet again, ten years after the fact. This adaptation of Scott Heim's book is also a poignant, moving story about friendship. Gregg Araki unleashes some of his familiar trademarks: aliens, teenage angst, jail-bait TV stars, and, of course, sex. With an all-white cast, this film expands the definition of the "Asian- American film" category.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, May 2 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Slow Jam King</STRONG><BR>
<I>Steve Mallorca, 2002 - 109m</I><BR>
Versed in gangsta-pimp culture, Jojo (Ron Domingo), a dutiful, meek, Filipino-American college student takes a leave of absence as a way of changing his persona. In his new rough and tough life, Jojo drags a kidnapped driver Vance (Whitney Melton) and his unfortunate passenger and friend Devuan (D.K. Bowser) on a roadtrip to Nashville. The journey brings the three men closer, and culminates in a country wedding-jilting face-off.<BR><BR>
<STRONG class="title">Following the screening, Director Steve Mallorca will be speaking and taking questions.</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, May 9 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Rice Rhapsody</STRONG><BR>
<I>Kenneth Bi, 2004 - 106m</I><BR>
What do you get when you throw Hainanese chicken rice, a traditional mother (Sylvia Chang, <I>Eat Drink Man Woman</I>, <I>The Red Violin</I>),  her three sons, two of whom are gay, and the star of <I>Yan Can Cook</I> (Martin Yan) together in a show about food, cultural differences and sexualities? Shot in seemingly straight-laced Singapore, <I>Rice Rhapsody</I> promises to transcend the supposed cultural and sexual boundaries that we place on ourselves and others by relating them to one of our favorite pleasures: food. While not strictly "Asian-American," it speaks to how we negotiate what it means to be "Asian."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, May 16 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Grace Lee Project</STRONG><BR>
<I>Grace Lee, 2003 - 68m</I><BR>
How many different Grace Lees can there be? As the only Grace Lee she knew in Missouri, director Grace Lee left home to question the assumption that all Grace Lees were reserved, dutiful, piano-playing overachievers. In preparing the film, the director made a website that included a survey that Grace Lees could fill out, another that "friends of Grace Lees" could complete, and an ongoing discussion group to discover the essence of Grace-Lee-ness, or lack thereof. Apparently some Grace Lees are quiet, while others are fiery social activists and rebels who've attempted to burn down schools.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, May 23 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Better Luck Tommorow</STRONG><BR>
<I>Justin Lin, 2005 - 101m</I><BR>
In Justin Lin's comical yet dark feature, a group of Asian-American high school over-achievers spiral down a path of crime from exam cheat sheets to drug dealing and beyond. Ben gets bored with his perfect Ivy-bound resume. Stephanie, the cheerleader who's rumored to have appeared in porn, only fuels Ben's drive to do whatever it takes. The sense of ennui that infects these youth is matched by their bland parentless surroundings in sunny, suburban Southern California. While this film initially drew some criticism for its depiction of Asian-Americans, it has also won praise and attention.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Tuesday, May 30 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Motel</STRONG><BR>
<I>Michael Kang, 2005 - 76m</I><BR>
Stuck in the most wholesome of places, 13-year-old Chinese-American Ernest finds himself struggling to grow up while working the desk and doing the housekeeping for his family's sleazy motel, babysitting his sister, and lying to his mother about his budding interest in writing. And his only solace and love-interest, Christine, thinks he is a dork. But when Sam Kim checks in with a reckless plan to sleep with as many ethnically diverse prostitutes as possible, Ernest finds an unlikely friend, and begins to bond with this Korean-American man over a midnight snack of fried chicken.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A name="wednesday" id="wednesday"></A>Wednesdays - Herzog</H3>

<P>Werner Herzog was one of the most important directors of the 1970's German New Wave, and his work continues to mesmerize audiences and critics fascinated by his particular "anti-humanist" world view.  Also: he once ate his shoe to settle a score.</P>


Wednesday, March 29 - 7:00

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Land of Silence and Darkness</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1971 - 90m</I><BR>
Herzog's characteristically stunning non-fiction debut follows Fini, a remarkably capable deaf-blind woman, who describes the "land" of deaf-blinds and acts as an emissary for both worlds.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">How Much Wood Would a Wood Chuck Chuck</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1977 - 45m</I><BR>
Herzog once called America "the most exotic country on the planet" for the antics and boldness of its people. This film about the World Championship of Livestock Auctioneers might help explain that statement. </BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, April 5 - 6:30

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Wheel of Time</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 2003 - 81m</I><BR>
Each year a group of Tibetan Buddhist monks toil at intricate sand paintings only to destroy them soon after completion.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Lessons of Darkness</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1992 - 54m</I><BR>
Herzog set the first Gulf War to Wagner and the results made everyone uncomfortable. The audience at the Berlin premiere booed and spat. In this country, critics were divided -- J. Hoberman adored it, while Jonathan Rosenbaum invoked Leni Riefenstahl. Come and judge for yourself.</BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, April 5 - 9:30
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sneak Preview: <STRONG class="title">American Dreamz</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, April 12 - 7:00

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">God's Angry Man</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1980 - 46m</I><BR>
All-too-relevant in light of the incendiary antics of Pat Robertson and others, Herzog documents the success of Dr. Gene Scott - a self-aggrandizing televangelist.  But neither the politics of religion nor the hypocrisy interest Herzog here; it is instead the character of Scott himself, whom he describes as "heartbreaking...very intelligent, but unhappy."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Huie's Sermon</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1980 - 40m</I><BR>
Herzog follows Bishop Huie Rogers, a black preacher deep in Brooklyn who "is more like a Rolling Stone than a man of the cloth."</BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, April 19 - 7:00

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The White Diamond</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 2004 - 90m</I><BR>
Returning to the South American rain forest, one of his favorite locations for both fiction and nonfiction films, Herzog finds another eccentric in professor and aviator Graham Dorrington, who has the idea to fly over and explore the Kaieteur Falls in Guyana in a diamond-shaped dirigible.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Herdsmen of the Sun</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1989 - 43m</I><BR>
In this TV program, Herzog plays anthropologist and films the gender-bending courting rituals of the sub-Saharan Wodaabe.</BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, April 26 - 7:00

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">La Soufriere</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1977 - 30m</I>
In 1977, geologists predicted that the volcano on the island of Guadeloupe would explode and kill anyone who stayed behind.  One man didn't listen.  Herzog found him.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Little Dieter Needs to Fly</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1997 - 80m</I>
Shot on location in Laos, where Herzog's subject, Dieter Dengler, was shot down and held prisoner in 1966, this powerful film is about both the particular horror of war and the way we as people and as an audience can remember traumas.  Look out for Herzog's fiction version <I>Rescue Dawn</I>, starring Christian Bale, to be released later this year.</BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, May 3 - 7:00

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Burden of Dreams</STRONG><BR>
<I>Les Blank, 1982 - 95m</I><BR>
Fellow filmmaker Les Blank followed Herzog on the set of his 1982 epic Fitzcarraldo - the story of a man trying to build a giant floating opera house in the middle of the Peruvian jungle. Be prepared for the weirdest and least conventional "making-of" documentary you'll ever see.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">My Best Fiend: Klaus Kinski</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1999 - 95m</I><BR>
Herzog was the only director to get a handle on the eccentric German actor Klaus Kinski (<I>Aguirre: The Wrath of God</I>, <I>Fitzcarraldo</I>). This documentary explores their long working relationship and strange friendship.</BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, May 10 - 7:00

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Gates of Heaven</STRONG><BR>
<I>Errol Morris, 1980 - 85m</I><BR>
Errol Morris' debut is a deservedly praised masterpiece of documentary.  His plan was to make a film about a pet cemetery in Northern California.  Herzog liked the idea so much that he told Morris that if he actually finished the film, he would eat his own shoe. (See below.) Without being heavy-handed or condescending, Morris accesses some essential human moments by simply letting people talk.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Werner Herzog Eats his Shoe</STRONG><BR>
<I>Les Blank, 1980 - 20m</I><BR>
Herzog makes good on his promise - on stage at UC Berkeley; Les Blank films.</BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, May 17 - 7:00

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Echoes from a Somber Empire</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1990 - 91m</I><BR>
The ruthless (most agree cannibalistic) dictator of the Central African Republic, Jean Bedel Bokassa, is the subject of this pondering on the nature of political tyranny. But just as in God's Angry Man, Herzog's interest is not with particular politics, but with Bokassa as an individual.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Ballad of the Little Soldier</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1984 - 45m</I><BR>
A strangely compassionate (but never pedantic) film about child soldiers caught in the Miskito Indian resistance in Nicaragua is also Herzog's most conventionally political.</BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, May 24 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Incident at Loch Ness</STRONG><BR>
<I>Zak Penn, 2004 - 94m</I><BR>
A mainline Hollywood producer, Zak Penn, set out to make a mainline mockumentary about a respected European filmmaker making a movie about the Loch Ness monster.  When they can't find the monster, the 
Hollywood director starts with the funny stuff. Herzog (roughly) plays himself as the European director more interested in the human need to believe than the monster. This broad comedy covers much of the ground of an actual Herzog documentary and features Herzog in what is probably the only role in which he is intentionally funny.</BLOCKQUOTE>


Wednesday, May 31 - 7:00<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Dark Glow of the Mountains</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1984 - 45m</I><BR>
Herzog follows mountaineer Reinhold Messner's quest to climb two of the world's highest peaks back-to-back. But this is no ordinary, uncritical fawning of the Uebermensch - Herzog  tries to understand what motivates someone who has done (and lost) so much to continually up the ante.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Fata Morgana</STRONG><BR>
<I>Werner Herzog, 1971 - 78m</I><BR>
Psychedelic does not begin to describe Herzog's early and most experimental non-fiction (or fiction) work. Ostensibly about Saharan decolonization, Fata charts the preternatural antagonism between humans and nature.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thursday, March 30 - 7:00

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Baby Face: The Uncut Version</STRONG><BR>
<I>Alfred E. Green, 1933 - 76m</I><BR>
The mother of all precode. In this infamous film, Barbara Stanwyck turns tricks in the backroom of her father's seedy speakeasy, then moves to the big city, where she sleeps her way to the top, floor by floor. Enjoy the recently discovered uncensored version!</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Female</STRONG><BR>
<I>Michael Curtiz, 1933 - 60m</I><BR>
By day, auto tycoon Ruth Chatterton rules the boardroom; at night, she treats the junior executive pool as her own personal stud farm. She's perfectly content to love 'em and leave 'em - until hunky inventor George Brent comes along. Wildly entertaining.</BLOCKQUOTE>


Thursday, April 6 - 7:30 (schedule change)
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Counsellor at Law</STRONG><BR>
<I>William Wyler, 1933 - 81m</I><BR>
Though little-known, this film has many ardent fans. Gripping, stylish, and fast-moving, it concerns a superstar ghetto-born lawyer in the midst of a personal and professional crisis. This film is distinguished by its toughmindedness and moral complexity; it's been called the most realistic drama ever made about the legal profession. Themes of class conflict and anti-Semitism are explored with startling honesty and intelligence. Best of all is John Barrymore's powerful and intensely moving performance in the title role; this is probably the film that best captures his greatness as an actor.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thursday, April 13 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Bombshell</STRONG><BR>
<I>Victor Fleming, 1933 - 96m</I><BR>
One of Jean Harlow's best films, this raucous screwball comedy concerns Lola Burns, a sexpot movie star coping with a career-threatening  scandal, a house full of freeloading relatives, and a suitor who says things like "Your hair is like a field of daisies - I should like to run barefoot through your hair!" Harlow, only 22 when this film was made, is a joy; never were her brilliant comic gifts shown to greater advantage. In the best precode tradition, Bombshell is bracingly unsentimental; the risque quips fly fast and furious. Co-starring Lee Tracy at his fast-talking best as Harlow's scheming press agent.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thursday, April 20 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">A Man's Castle</STRONG><BR>
<I>Frank Borzage, 1933 - 75m</I><BR>
In this luminous melodrama set in an impoverished shantytown, macho blue-collar guy Spencer Tracy reluctantly takes in homeless, waif-like Loretta Young. Gradually, and much to his surprise, he finds himself falling deeply in love with her. With a plot that centers on unwed pregnancy and premarital shacking up, this film could not have been made just a year later, when the Hays production code was firmly in place. But what is most memorable here is the contrast between the harshness and squalor of the Depression-era setting, and the sublimity of Borzage's magical, almost fairy tale-like romanticism.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thursday, April 27 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Trouble in Paradise</STRONG><BR>
<I>Ernst Lubitsch, 1932 - 83m</I><BR>
Lubitsch's masterpiece, and one of the greatest comedies ever made. Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins star as a pair of suave Riviera jewel thieves who fall in love picking each other's pockets. But their bliss is threatened by the arrival of rich Parisienne widow Kay Francis. Lubitsch creates an irresistibly elegant world of shimmering art deco sophistication; he later said, "For pure style, I have done nothing better or as good as <I>Trouble in Paradise</I>." Given its witty sexual suggestiveness and amoral protagonists, it's not surprising that the film was not approved for reissue in 1935, post-code. Archival print.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thursday, May 4 - 7:00<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Call Her Savage</STRONG><BR>
<I>John Francis Dillon, 1932 - 92m</I><BR>
Precode cinema at its most lurid. Clara Bow is the hellion, and frequently braless, daughter of a wealthy Texan. After her dad packs her off to Chicago (!) for charm school (!!), her Paris Hilton-style antics turn her into a tabloid heroine. From then on it's one surreal moment after another as Clara catfights Thelma Todd, beats her lowlife hubby senseless, gets a little too close for comfort to her Great Dane, and visits the cinema's first gay bar, complete with a floorshow featuring drag queens in frilly aprons. It's a wild ride, held together by the by the vitality and charisma of Bow's unforgettable performance.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thursday, May 11 - 7:00
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Private Lives</STRONG><BR>
<I>Sidney Franklin, 1931 - 92m</I><BR>
Noel Coward's sparkling comedy of manners stars Robert Montgomery and Norma Shearer as Amanda and Elyot, a pair of glittering sophisticates who can't stay together, yet can't keep apart. This film is said to preserve the buoyant spirits of the legendary original theatrical production, and Shearer, best known for the prim and proper ladies she played later in her career, shows a much livelier, sexier side of herself here. The dry-eyed, light-hearted attitude toward marriage, divorce, and adultery displayed here would rarely be seen in the Hollywood of subsequent decades, particularly not on the MGM lot.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Raoul Walsh, 1932 - 79m</I><BR>
In this unsung classic, hash slinger Joan Bennett and cop Spencer Tracy trade one-liners like a working class Beatrice and Benedick. The plot concerns romance and a foiled robbery, but what's most memorable about this film is its warm, freewheeling portrait of working-class, Depression-era New York. It's full of priceless throwaway gags, oddball characters, and tossed-off asides, including a hilarious parody of O'Neill's <I>Strange Interlude</I>, and it has a vitality that represents pre-code at its most joyous. Part romance, part screwball comedy, part gangster flick, this is a mangy, lovable mutt of a film.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Roy Del Ruth, 1932 - 80m</I><BR>
Wisecracking Lee Tracy gave his most inspired performance in this delightfully cynical newspaper comedy, in which he plays a cheerfully sleazy tabloid columnist. Dick Powell is the sappy crooner he detests. Off-color references to abortion, homosexuality, and adultery abound. Archival print.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Three on a Match</STRONG><BR>
<I>Mervyn LeRoy, 1932 - 64m</I><BR>
This hardboiled melodrama concerns a reunion of three old friends (Bette Davis, Joan Blondell, and Ann Dvorak). The juicy plot involves illicit sex, cocaine, and blackmail. Archival print.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Bitter Tea of General Yen</STRONG><BR>
<I>Frank Capra, 1933 - 98m</I><BR>
Capra's most uncharacteristic film is said by some to be his finest. Doc patron saint Barbara Stanwyck stars as a prim missionary taken prisoner by a Chinese general in wartorn Shanghai. Despite vast differences in background, culture, and national origin, the two come to feel deep passion for one another; reportedly, this was one of the films that led the Hays code to ban depictions of interracial romance. The atmospheric sensuality and visual style are reminiscent of Sternberg, but this dazzling film weaves a seductive spell all its own; look for an especially startling erotic dream sequence.

<I>Monte Hellman, 1971 - 102m</I><BR>
Proclaimed by an Esquire cover story to be the next <I>Easy Rider</I>, Monte Hellman's existential road movie never approached that level of recognition.  James Taylor and Beach Boy Dennis Wilson are the Driver and the Mechanic, part of a national underground racing circuit.  As they travel eastward they become entangled with the Girl (Laurie Bird) and GTO (Warren Oates), a strange man consumed with the idea of besting them in a cross-country race.  A genuine classic of the American New Wave, its unconventional casting and enigmatic conclusion would surely please the makers of its European forebears.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Swimmer</STRONG><BR> 
<I>Frank Perry, 1968 - 95m</I><BR>
"When you talk about The Swimmer, will you talk about yourself?"  Burt Lancaster is Ned Merrill, a fallen Connecticut suburbanite who attempts to "swim home" through the backyard pools of his affluent neighbors.  Lancaster is remarkable in this offbeat and haunting adaptation of the John Cheever story from husband and wife team Frank and Eleanor Perry (David & Lisa).  Shelved and then re-edited by its producer, the film was released to indifferent box office and reviews, but has since emerged as one of the most singular and influential films of the sixties.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Taking Off</STRONG> (replacing <I>Petulia</I>)<BR>
<I>Milos Forman, 1971 - 93 min.</I><BR>
One of several films produced by Universal's short-lived "youth unit," Forman's rarely seen first American film is a perceptive and amusing examination of the "flower power" era.  Square couple Buck Henry and Lynn Carlin are forced to venture outside of their cloistered Queens existence when their teenage hippie daughter runs away to the East Village.  On their search they learn to loosen up and enjoy life more than ever before.  The film features a memorable strip poker scene and appearances by Ike and Tina Turner and a young Carly Simon.  Co-written by Forman, John Guare, Jean-Claude Carriere, and Jon Klein. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Petulia</STRONG><BR>
<I>Richard Lester, 1968 - 105m</I><BR>
American director Lester made his mark in Britain with a string of popular Beatles films and then returned to the States to make this, his masterpiece.  Recently divorced George C. Scott becomes involved with beautiful kook Julie Christie in 'Summer of Love'-era San Francisco in this melancholic tale, which captures the zeitgeist and confusion of the era.  Stylishly shot by future director Nicolas Roeg, with radical editing techniques reminiscent of the Nouvelle Vague, this is one of the best and most criminally underrated films of the 60's.  Look for early musical performances 
by the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Pretty Poison</STRONG><BR>
<I>Noel Black, 1968 - 89m</I><BR>
"We met on Monday.  Fell in love on Tuesday.  Thursday we killed a guy together."  Unavailable on home video, Black's rarely seen small-town noir predates the films of David Lynch by a decade.  Recently let out of an asylum, Anthony Perkins pretends that he's a secret agent in an effort to woo cheerleader Tuesday Weld.  In way over his head, Perkins is soon wrapped around the finger of the scheming and murderous Weld.  A sharp screenplay and the interplay of the iconic leads have made this a cult favorite.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Revolutionary</STRONG><BR>
<I>Paul Williams, 1970 - 100m</I><BR>
Jon Voight (hot off of <I>Midnight Cowboy</I>) is a budding student radical who gets in too deep when he comes under the spell of activist factory worker Robert Duvall and violent extremist Seymour Cassel.  Be-fore leaving Hollywood for the Arica cult, Williams (not the diminutive singer-songwriter) was a cohort of Brian DePalma and producer Edward Pressman, and made memorable radical youth films like this one and <I>Dealing: Or the Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick Lost-Bag Blues</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Arthur Penn, 1965 - 93 min.</I><BR>
Before they made <I>Bonnie & Clyde</I> together, director Arthur Penn and Warren Beatty collaborated on the rarely-seen <I>Mickey One</I>, a film  directly inspired by the French Nouvelle Vague. Beatty is "Mickey  One," a comic who's convinced that the mafia is out to kill him.   Shot in black and white by renowned cinematographer Ghislain Cloquet (<I>Night & Fog</I>), the film follows Mickey from Detroit to Chicago and  moves to the herky-jerky rhythms of a hip jazz score by Eddie Sauter (featuring sax solos by Stan Getz) and its non-linear, Kafkaesque storyline. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Wanda</STRONG><BR>
<I>Barbara Loden, 1971 - 102m</I><BR>
A true anomaly, especially in a male-dominated era, Loden wrote, directed, and starred in this moving docudrama about an uneducated divorced woman who takes up with a no-good thief.  Shot in 16mm with few resources, this film remains a true independent in an age when the word has lost much of its cache.  Married to Elia Kazan, Loden would die young and never have the opportunity to direct another film.  Rarely seen these days, the film has never been released on home video.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">Point Blank</STRONG>
<I>John Boorman, 1967 - 92m</I>
British director Boorman and star Lee Marvin, who would later team up for <I>Hell in the Pacific</I>, made their first and greatest contribution together with this lean neo-noir oozing with cinematic style and panache. Betrayed by his partners and left for dead on Alcatraz, professional thief Walker (Marvin) miraculously survives and will not quit until they all pay. Tour-de-force shot composition and use of colors and editing make this visionary film at least the equal of the year's other watershed violent film, <I>Bonnie and Clyde</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG class="title">The Panic in Needle Park</STRONG><BR>
<I>Jerry Schatzberg, 1971 - 110m</I><BR>
"God help Bobby and Helen. They're in love in Needle Park."  Young junkies Al Pacino and Kitty Winn hover around Needle Park looking for their next fix.  A harrowing near-documentary study of New York's heroin epidemic, it remains one of the best films to tackle the topic of drug addiction.  This was the film that led Coppola to cast the unknown Pacino as Michael Corleone; co-star Winn would win Best Actress at Cannes for her efforts.  The film was adapted from the James Mills book by Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>John Huston, 1972 - 100m</I><BR>
Huston made one of his great pictures with this faithful adaptation of Leonard Gardner's hard-hitting novel.  Stacy Keach, in one of the decade's best performances, is a veteran club fighter with nothing left, who tries to pass on some of his knowledge to a talented kid (Jeff Bridges) who thinks he has nothing to learn.  This is a sad gem of a film with fine supporting work from Candy Clark, Nicholas Colasanto ('Coach' on "Cheers"), and inimitable Warhol favorite Susan Tyrrell.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>James William Guercio, 1973 - 114m</I><BR> 
"He's a good cop.  On a big bike.  On a bad road."  Chicago rock impresario/producer Guercio made his only feature film with this stunningly shot (by the legendary Conrad Hall) tale of an honest Arizona motorcycle cop (Robert Blake) who longs to trade in his wheels for a Stetson and a detective's gold shield.  Once promoted, he discovers corruption in his own ranks and finds that the understanding he shows towards hippies and dropouts may not be reciprocated.  A modern Western in which motorcycles replace horses, but the Monument Valley locales remain.</BLOCKQUOTE>

circa 1986, in an autobiographical examination of familial dissolution.

From the director of <I>The Wedding Banquet</I>, <I>Eat Drink Man Woman</I> and <I>Crouching Tiger,

Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two lonely cowboys who fall in love but, afraid of discrimination, decide to keep their relationship a secret for the next 20 years of their lives.

In a rollicking remake of Mel Brooks' hit Broadway musical, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick shine in the roles they defined on the stage. Failed producer Max Bialystock (Lane) is inspired by the idea of accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick) to raise 25,000% of a play's expenses, provided the play is so bad that it will close after opening night. They set out to produce "Springtime For Hitler," but fail to anticipate that the show might actually be a hit.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Jane Austen's famous novel about class, wealth, and romance in late 18th century England, like its heroine Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley), was ahead of its time. This lush film adaptation of Austen's work, rife with exciting cinematography and strong performances, gives Bennett's character ample space to show just how far ahead she really was. "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife," begins Austen's novel, and it proceeds to track one such single man as he looks for one.

Chris Wilton, a former tennis pro, starts giving lessons at an elite club, and quickly climbs the social ladder to a cushy marriage and a plum business job. Put off by the monotony of his new life, Wilton begins to live a second one, and things soon devolve into a shocking mess.</BLOCKQUOTE>

A newlywed Chicago couple visits piedmont North Carolina so that Madeline, a dealer in avant-garde art, can seek business from a hermit whose paintings bear a deep nostalgia for the Confederate South. Killing two birds with one stone, the couple uses the trip as an opportunity to see her husband George's estranged Carolina family. The visit brings to surface the expected cultural tensions as well as the fragile and eccentric dynamics of the family.

It would be more than fair to call Hollywood's 2005 the year of George Clooney. Serving here as director and supporting actor, Clooney brings us the timely tale of journalist Edward R. Murrow's battle against Senator Joseph McCarthy's effort to blacklist hundreds of public figures as Communists.  David Straithairn plays Murrow perfectly by maintaining a cool, understated sparseness. Filmed in period black and white, <I>Good Night, and Good Luck</I> works both as a vivid retelling of an important political moment and as a compelling reminder that history often repeats itself.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Michael Winterbottom (<I>24-Hour Party People</I>, <I>9 Songs</I>) makes a movie out of the notoriously "unfilmable" 18th century novel <I>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</I> in which the eponymous narrator's retelling of his life story is plagued by bawdy and playful digressions to the point that he barely gets to telling his own birth.

Connecting the wars in Vietnam, Bolivia, and Chile, and the near-revolutions of 1968, Marker's film refuses to dissociate political revolution from the machinery and effects of cinema.  More than anything else, the film is a damning look at the uses of media by and about political movements, irregardless of their goals.  About this film, Marker wrote, "Some think the third World War will be set off by a nuclear missile. For me, that's the way it will end."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Patrick Keiller, 1994 - 85m</I><BR>
<I>London</I> captures a great city in deep decline.  Narrated by Paul Scofield, Keiller's masterful film is a fiendishly complex concatenation of the fragments of a city still able to shock one out of quotidian existence, a desperate effort to mythologize a place that has abandoned its own history. Preceded by three shorts. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Starting with a 1942 talk Martin Heidegger gave on Friedrich Hoelderlin's poetry, <I>The Ister</I> explores Heidegger's thought within its geographical context as a kind of accompaniment to the lecture.  With commentary by philosophers Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Bernard Stiegler, and the filmmaker Hans-Juergen Syberberg, Barison and Ross's film travels along the course of the Danube, which the Greeks called 'istros,' from Romania to the Black Forest, delving into issues of ethics, technology, and Heidegger's Nazi affiliations as it analyzes the history and implications of his philosophical project.</BLOCKQUOTE>
