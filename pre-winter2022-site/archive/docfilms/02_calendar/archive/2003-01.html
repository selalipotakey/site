Msimangu is amissionary-schooled, black South African priest, whose asexuality, gradualistpolitics, and cool-headed sophistication became part of Sidney Poitier'strademark "unreality." Poitier's appearance in this once-controversial filmalso demonstrates the actor's larger concerns with mining literary material forAfrican-American performance and addressing social problems through films.<spanstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><p><p><br />January19<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Intruderin the Dust</span><br />ClarenceBrown, 1949<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>87m<p>Intruderis adapted from William Faulkner's novel about politics in the South.

Christine arranges for her youngest sister, Lea (Julie-Marie Parmentier of I'm Going Home),  to join her as a maid at the Lancelin household, where they cling to each other as their only comfort. Their co-dependency evolves into an intimate sexual relationship, which is a surprise and a delight to both sisters.  <br />The story of the Papin sister has been taken up by many writers over the past seventy years, including Jean Genet ("The Maids") and most by recently Nancy Meckler, in her 1994 film, Sister My Sister. At times, the Papins' story has been portrayed as one of class struggle, or as proof of the violent and demented roots of homosexuality. Director Jean-Pierre Denis treats the story more carefully, focusing on the very personal psychological development of the two girls. Testud gives a chilling and emotional performance as Christine Papin, portraying her gradual descent into madness (which psychologists would later diagnose as paranoid schizophrenia). Christine is dominating and jealous, but also terrified. She alternates between fitful outbursts and trembling in fear. Lea, by comparison, is portrayed as innocent and naïve, falling helplessly into the great storm of her sister's madness, and participating in her employers' murders out of devotion to Christine.<p><p><br />February10<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Vasavoir </span><br />JacquesRivette, 2001<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>154m<p>Rivette'snimble romantic comedy charts the amorous entanglements of six charactersthrough a changing arrangement of couples. Camille (Jeanne Balibar), an actorin an Italian theatre troupe who left her lover Pierre (Jacques Bonnaff&eacute;) threeyears earlier, returns to Paris for a short run of a Pirandello play in whichshe plays the lead. Ugo (Sergio Castellitto), the play's director and Camille'scurrent lover, obsesses about finding the text of a lost 18th century Italianplay rumored to be in Paris. Full of witty dialogue and winning performances,the film's light touch and, for Rivette (<i>La Belle Noiseuse</i>), moderate length, make it one of thedirector's most accessible.<p><p><br />February17<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">ReadMy Lips</span><br />JacquesAudiard, 2001<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>115m<p>CarlaBhem (Emmanuelle Devos), a secretary for a property development company, readslips due to a hearing impairment. Work frustrates Carla, but her young,inexperienced trainee, Paul (Vincent Cassel), proves quite interesting. Carlahires Paul after his release from prison for reasons more personal thanprofessional. She teaches him good manners and he teaches her naughty ones, andthrough his criminal connections the two become involved in a heist. However,their characters, not the crime, provide the lynchpin of this film. Thisunlikely couple, both unsatisfied in their respective roles, share a workplaceand a joint criminal venture, and more. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><p><p><br />February24<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">8Women</span><br />Fran&ccedil;oisOzon, 2002<span style='mso-tab-count:2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>103m<p>Playingout like a demented Clue, <i>8 Women</i></span>is a quirky French murder mystery with a musical twist.

Anne Fontaine, the director of the droll Dry Cleaning, takes onthe Freudian conflict between father and son. Forty year-old Jean-Luc (CharlesBerling) is a successful gerontologist living in the wealthy Parisian suburb ofVersailles with his beautiful wife, Isa (Natacha Regnier).Jean-Luc appears tohave everything one could want from life, but when his long estranged fatherMaurice (Michel Bouquet) unexpected arrives, it threatens to shatter Jean-Luc'sfacade.

But Edgar doesn't yet know what form the final project willtake. While auditioning actors, he encounters a woman (C&eacute;cile Camp) perfect fora role, but when he decides to cast her he learns that she has died. The firstpart of the film is shot in a luminous black-and-white reminiscent of Godard'swork of the 1960's, and even revisits some of the same locations. In the secondpart, set two years earlier, Godard uses super-saturated video to convey thesense of a still vibrant past.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><p><p><br /><a name="dames"></a><span class="series">Fast-Talking Dames</span><br /><br />January7<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Dinnerat Eight</span><br />GeorgeCukor, 1933<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>113m<p>JeanHarlow heads an all-star cast in this luscious Art Deco adaptation of thefamous George S.

In this film, Nick (William Powell) and Nora areat their irreverent, cocktail-swilling best as they investigate the mysteriousdisappearance of an eccentric inventor. <i>The Thin Man</i>, based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett,took only 16 days to film and was a hugely popular success.

Husky-voiced Jean Arthur co-stars as BabeBennett, the reporter whose hardened exterior hides a tender heart. Mr. Deeds'"share the wealth" redistribution plan is a prime example of the New Dealpopulism that infused so many of Capra's Depression-era films.

At the movie's outset, Grant's character is simultaneously trying tomanage the arrival of a rare dinosaur bone, a meeting with a wealthy donor, andhis marriage to the ultra-proper Miss Swallow (Virginia Walker). But thearrival of &nbsp;Hepburn, the madcap heroine who brings chaos wherever shegoes, turns his life upside down. Directed by Howard Hawks, this fast-paced,absurdist farce is centered, thematically, on the principles of wildness andanarchy vs. order and propriety.<p><p><br />March4<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Midnight</span><br />MitchellLeisen, 1939 <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>94m<p>MitchellLeisen's enjoyable film follows American chorus girl Eva Peabody (ClaudetteColbert), who finds herself stranded in Paris.

Lynchgrew up in small town America, or rather several small American towns, as hisfather constantly moved the family. The unmistakable Lynchian small town (Lumberton,Twin Peaks) certainly arose from this period, while his first feature, <i>Eraserhead</i>, owes more to his time in Philadelphia.Before that film, later a cult classic, Lynch experimented with several shortfilms ("Six Figures Getting Sick," "The Amputee")<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>included in part here.<p><p><br />January15<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00<br /><span class="title">Eraserhead</span><br />DavidLynch, 1977<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>90m<p>DavidLynch shot this, his debut feature film as a film student in Philadelphia. Thestory centers around Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a young man struggling withthe idea of fatherhood. His wife, Mary X, gives birth to a monstrous, deformedbaby whose wail threatens to push her over the edge. Befriended by a woman wholives in his radiator, Spencer finally decides to murder his own child. Set ina nightmarish industrial landscape, this five-year project has all the surreal,horrific trimmings of Lynch's later, higher-budget films. Lynch described thismasterpiece as "a dream of dark and troubling things".

A surgeon, Sir FrederickTreves (Anthony Hopkins), rescues Merrick from the cruel circus world and giveshim housing, but when Merrick meets a stage performer (Anne Bancroft), hisgrowing fame forces him again to face those who ridicule him. Based on thechronicle by Treves, this film was nominated for eight Academy Awards,including Best Actor, Best Picture, and Best Director.

The application of Lynch's style to thescience fiction medium results in some of the most striking and cohesive sci-fiset design since Blade Runner. The futuristic story of Paul Atreides (KyleMcLachlan) and the strategically important, parched, worm-ridden planetDune—the only location of a certain life-enhancing spice—features a cast ofthousands.

Jeffrey Beaumont (played by Lynch regular KyleMacLachlan) makes the old mistake, and finds the usual sleepy streets, blueskies, red roses, white picket fences, and that severed human ear. Perhaps themost beautiful of all of his films, Lynch's skill as a painter is apparent inthe careful composition of an indelible scene featuring Isabella Rossellini(one of history's most beautiful women) lying naked on a manicured lawn whilesimultaneously conveying brutality, dignity and desire.

Into this world ofdeceptive fa&ccedil;ades comes Betty (Naomi Watts), a ray of cheerful sunshine fromthe great happy province of Ontario. Her outlook on life in Los Angeles harkensback to the bumpkin disposition of cheap novels and Shirley Temple movies: Butin the this Nathanael West world, nothing is possible.

Ordered to remain silent, he has followed his instructions until now. This taped confession was to remain under Ohlinger's control until his death. It was his terminal cancer that convinced him to talk. But is this the truth? What does one accept as truth? Due to the avalanche of material in such books as Gus Russo, Fletcher Prouty, Jim Marrs and given wide exposure by Oliver Stone's JFK, few Americans still believe in the lone gunman in Dealy Plaza. Does that make Ohlinger's story more credible, or less? How should his evidence, both informational and physical, be evaluated? How can truth be discerned now that the Kennedy assassination has transcended History into myth, lore, and commerce? If Lee Harvey Oswald was not alone, then someone else remains at large.
