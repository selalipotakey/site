<h1> Fall 2008, Sunday Series &bull; Edgar G. Ulmer</h1>

<p><em>Morality Plays of Light and Shadow </em></p>

<p>How do we define body of work, in cinema or any art? What do we mean when we praise an artist for their diversity? For the history of the classic Hollywood cinema, these questions acquire a particular urgency when battling the customs of an amnesiac media culture.</p> 
<p>Few filmmakers could lay claim to as diverse a filmography as Edgar Georg Ulmer. Born in Vienna in 1904, Ulmer probably worked on his first film as an art director or set designer as early as 1919, thus beginning a career, which would span nearly the entire first half of film history concluding with The Cavern, his magnum opus of 1964 (previously exhibited at Doc this summer). During this time, Ulmer professed to have directed 128 films of which approximately 42 have been accounted for by most modern filmographies, but these usually do not include the few shorts he made, nor a number of two-reeler westerns he said he shot while fulfilling his contract at Universal Studios, nor the medical documentaries he made. <strong><A href="#essay" onclick="toggle_visibility('essay');">more</a></strong></p>

<div id="essay" style="display:none;">

<p> To most of those who know him, Ulmer is remembered chiefly for two films, the 1934 <em>The Black Cat</em> and the 1946 <strong><em><a href="#Detour">Detour</a></em></strong> (10/26). Both have been canonized as classics of their period and genre, the former as a peculiarly perverse entry in the Universal horror cycle of the 1930s, the latter as a seminal work in the development of film noir.</p> 

<p>A smaller group probably remembers him for the ethnic productions he made in the late thirties in New York, such as the 1939 Black American allegory <strong><em><a href="#MoonOverHarlem">Moon Over Harlem</a></em></strong> (10/5) and a cycle of four Yiddish films (three of which Doc is pleased to screen this quarter as part of <strong><a href="Yiddish08.shtml">Oy Revolt!</a></strong>, a retrospective of Yiddish cinema on Thursday nights). Others have recognized Ulmer as an important contributor to the history of B-grade productions, to which he added, alongside the aforementioned Detour, the penny dreadful 1944 <strong><em><a href="#Bluebeard">Bluebeard </a></em></strong>(10/12), and the 1945 Freudian melodrama <strong><em><a href="#StrangeIllusion">Strange Illusion</a></em></strong> (10/19), among a host of others, all filmed while working at the Producers Releasing Corporation. Still others prize him for the schlock of his late career, films like the one-two punch of sci-fi thrillers <strong><em><a href="#TheAmazingTransparentMan">The Amazing Transparent Man</a></em></strong> (11/23) and <strong><em><a href="#BeyondtheTimeBarrier">Beyond the Time Barrier</a></em></strong> (11/30), both from 1960, prized more often for, and not in spite of, their outlandish premises, dime store scripting, and fairground production values.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, Ulmer&#8217;s is an extraordinarily unpredictable output, defiant of any attempt to classify it along conventional lines of genre, taste, or style. Some have seen in this diversity, an embarrassing over-eagerness on Ulmer&#8217;s part to subject himself to the worst kinds of artistic self-abasement. They have focused on poverty and compromise as the rule of his career, a rule intermittently interrupted by his mastery of cinematic space, a redeeming factor, which occasionally elevates the work to allow a glimpse of a powerful artistic vision. No less influential a critic than Andrew Sarris defined the parameters of the debate, when he wrote, &#8220;most of Ulmer&#8217;s films are of interest only to unthinking audiences or specialists in mise-en-sc&egrave;ne.&#8221; A less apologetic, more inclusive appreciation of this artist&#8217;s multifarious achievements has not yet surfaced.</p>

<p>To be sure, it is probably a general rule that when critics seek singularity and unity, they do so often at the expense of variety. As John Ford famously sought to remind interviewers, he hadn&#8217;t just made westerns. Still, today few would question the contention that Ford&#8217;s films represent a contiguous collection of films, where the whole is only enriched by the multiplicity of inflections. With Ulmer, it has been more difficult to say so, his films splaying as they do in so many, apparently irreconcilable directions. Thus, how can Ulmer evoke both Nathanial Hawthorne and Carl Dreyer in his 1946 <strong><em><a href="#TheStrangeWoman">The Strange Woman</a></em></strong> (11/9)? How can 1955&#8217;s <strong><em><a href="#TheNakedDawn">The Naked Dawn</a></em></strong> (11/16) be more science fiction than western?</p>

<p>Ulmer&#8217;s films certainly evidence an aesthetic, expressing a deeply personal philosophical project about which the curious reader may refer to film critic Tag Gallagher&#8217;s comprehensive article &#8220;All Lost in Wonder: Edgar G. Ulmer&#8221;, which is available for free online. Still, the outward manifestations this project takes are, film-to-film, chameleonic and various, and it is this diversity of expression, which our retrospective seeks to emphasize. The story of Ulmer&#8217;s career is the story of a tendency toward flexibility, a willingness to adapt to fluctuating, often wretched circumstances, to rise and sink to the level of his material, always with a mind to making the most of it. It is the story not of compromise, but of the synergy of a filmmaker and his material. When Jonas Mekas imagined &#8220;monks of the order of cinema&#8221;, he may as well have meant Ulmer. For Ulmer&#8217;s work has always been a pilgrimage, encompassing every cinematic landscape our collective imagination might conceive, earning its verisimilitude across a wide range of tonalities. <strong>EC</strong> <strong><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('essay');">close</a></strong></p></div>

    <strong>Moon Over Harlem<br />
    </strong><em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1939</em> &bull; This musical melodrama is set mainly in a Harlem nightclub featuring an all-black cast, a chorus, choir, and sixty-piece orchestra. Yet Ulmer claimed that shooting took four days, two for studio and two for location photography, a testament to his genius at negotiating tight budgets and poetic aspirations. An allegory of contemporary Harlem, the film is a tale of seduction and redemption, of a gangster named Dollar conning a wealthy widow, and marrying into her fortune. The widow&#8217;s daughter and her boyfriend, an idealistic community organizer, must transcend the evils Dollar has brought on their house.</p>

      <strong>Bluebeard</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1944</em> &bull; The first of three masterpieces Ulmer would make while working at the poverty row studio Producers Releasing Corporation, this Victorian Gothic potboiler, about a Parisian puppeteer whose search for the ideal beauty leads to the death by strangling of many a failed candidate, features John Carradine as the obsessed romantic lead, Gaston Morrel. The role was one of the esteemed character actor&#8217;s favorites, and displays him at his most commanding and sublime. The cinematography is by frequent Ulmer collaborator Eugen Sch&uuml;fftan, who achieves an atmosphere of luminous decadence.</p>
  <p>Sunday, October 19 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 84min<a name="StrangeIllusion" id="StrangeIllusion"></a><br />
    <strong>Strange Illusion<strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/04Week/Ulmer_Strange_Illusion.jpg" width="71" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    </strong><em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1945</em> &bull; Shortly before the release of <em>Bluebeard</em>, Ulmer began work on this most liberal of adaptations of <em>Hamlet</em> at PRC. Also photographed by Sch&uuml;fftan, the film elaborates the former work&#8217;s preoccupations with the atmospherics of madness. Ulmer&#8217;s Hamlet is the son of a deceased judge named Cartwright, whose delirious nightmares reveal to him an Oedipal figuration of sinister evil, claiming to be his new father. When that figure becomes a perverse reality, a child molesting serial murderer who aggressively courts the hero’s innocent mother, Ulmer can barely hide his delight at the ensuing Freudian morality play.</p>
  
  <p>Sunday, October 26&bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 67min<a name="Detour" id="Detour"></a><br />
      <strong>Detour</strong><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/05Week/Ulmer_Detour.jpg" width="66" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1946 </em>&bull; Alongside <em>The Black Cat</em>, this PRC thriller is Ulmer&#8217;s most celebrated film. Canonized as a film noir essential, the film sports a set-up, which recalls the clipped cynicism of such 30s fiction as <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em> (adapted the same year in a typically glossy MGM production starring John Garfield and Lana Turner). While hitchhiking west, a down-onhis- luck pianist becomes embroiled in a web of sex, murder and extortion. But Ulmer&#8217;s illusory treatment transcends the cheap premise, the six-day shooting schedule, and the $20,000 budget, to create a nightscape as disorienting as it is entrancing.</p>
<p>Sunday, November 9 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 101min<a name="TheStrangeWoman" id="TheStrangeWoman"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/07Week/Ulmer_The_Strange_Woman.jpg" width="133" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>The Strange Woman</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1946</em> &bull; This stormy melodrama of Hawthorne&#8217;s New England was, for once in Ulmer&#8217;s career, a bona fide A-picture, starring the voluptuous Hedy Lamarr as a working-class wench who sleeps her way to wealth and power in the fur traders&#8217; city of Bangor, Maine. On set, a baton-wielding Ulmer measured the rhythms of the diva&#8217;s delivery, slapping her legs if she broke time. The result is one of the most intense female performances in cinema, worthy of those Carl Dreyer achieved from Lisbeth Movin for <em>Day of Wrath</em>, and Nina Pens Rode for <em>Gertrud</em>, films to which <em>The Strange Woman</em> bears close relation.</p>
<p>Sunday, November 17 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 82min<a name="TheNakedDawn" id="TheNakedDawn"></a><br />
      <strong>The Naked Dawn</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1955</em> &bull; &#8220;It&#8217;s one of his few films in color, and perhaps the most perversely underpopulated western ever made &#8211; it seems to be taking place on Mars,&#8221; notes Dave Kehr, whose comments should give some idea of Ulmer&#8217;s radically unorthodox approach to the Western. Here, the landscape becomes an unearthly witness to an innocent young couple&#8217;s fall from grace when they encounter Santiago, a bandit who instructs them in rituals of lawlessness and corruption. A final scene signals crucifixion and redemption for the characters, who, like all Ulmer heroes, never waiver in the face of entrapping subjectivity.</p>
<p>Sunday, November 23 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 57min<a name="TheAmazingTransparentMan" id="TheAmazingTransparentMan"></a><br />
      <strong>The Amazing Transparent Man</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1960</em> &bull; Shot over the same three-week period in Dallas as <em>Beyond the Time Barrier</em> (both productions employed make-shift sets provided by the Texas Fairground) this science-fiction thriller follows escaped convict Joey Faust, the accomplice of a crazed, former US army major, who plots to conquer the world with an army of invisible soldiers. It&#8217;s a spectacularly incoherent premise, which allows Ulmer free reign to create some striking sequences, such as Faust&#8217;s nocturnal flight from prison. Shooting day-for-night, Ulmer takes advantage of the dawn&#8217;s low-light levels to silhouette his figures against the environment.</p>
	  <p>Sunday, November 30 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 75min<a name="BeyondtheTimeBarrier" id="BeyondtheTimeBarrier"></a><br />
      <strong>Beyond the Time Barrier</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar Gr. Ulmer, 1960</em> &bull; This sci-fi piece was produced to exploit the success that same year of George Pal&#8217;s <em>The Time Machine</em>. A pilot testing a new rocket-powered jet unwittingly breaks the time barrier! Returning to Earth, he finds it deserted and in disrepair, but struck unconscious, wakes up inside a pyramidal underground citadel whose sterile inhabitants want to use him to breed with their ruler&#8217;s daughter. The film&#8217;s sexual politics alone merit interest: all the women are dressed in short skirts and heels, only to be punished for their indiscretion by teeming mutants. Featuring Ulmer&#8217;s daughter Arianne as the deadly femme fatale.</p>
