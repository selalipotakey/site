    <strong>Mystery Train</strong><br />
    <em>Jim Jarmusch</em>, 1989 &bull; The first of Jim Jarmusch&#8217;s omnibus films presents three stories in non-linear chronology, set around a rundown Memphis hotel where the night clerk is Screamin&#8217; Jay Hawkins. Hawkins&#8217;s music was the unseen star of Jarmusch&#8217;s Stranger Than Paradise; here it is the spirit of Elvis Presley that permeates the film. The first segment concerns a pair of Elvis-obsessed Japanese tourists, the second an Italian widow who receives a visit from The King, and the third Joe Strummer as a would-be robber nicknamed Elvis. Watch for a cameo by singer Rufus Thomas and listen for Tom Waits&#8217;s voice as a radio DJ.</p>

      <strong>Bird with the Crystal Plumage</strong><br />
    <em>Dario Argento, 1969 &bull; </em>Dario Argento&#8217;s seminal <em>giallo</em> wasn&#8217;t the first, but it was the film to truly popularize the craze, with subsequent films obsessively copying its suspenseful stalking scenes as well as its [animal]-[adjective]-[noun] title. Setting the bar high in terms of the genre&#8217;s baroque theatrics, Bird finds handsome young American artist Tony Musante witnessing an attempted murder while trapped between panes of glass in the entryway to an art gallery. Drawn increasingly deeper into the case, Musante comes to discover that there was more to this situation than initially met the eye.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

      <strong>The Seventh Seal</strong><br />
    <em>Ingmar Bergman, 1957 &bull;</em> One of the most iconic (and most parodied) foreign art films, The Seventh Seal is the story of a 14th century knight (Max von Sydow) who upon returning home from the Crusades plays a game of chess with Death in a battle for his life. As a result of the war and the despair of the plague-ridden land to which he has returned, the knight suffers a crisis of faith. As he buys time through the game of chess, he deliberates on the meaning of life, death and the existence of God, questions that would plague Bergman for the next two decades. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles.</em></p>

      <strong>Ost und West (East and West)</strong><br />
    <em>Sidney M. Golden &amp; Ivan Abramson, 1923</em> &bull; What happens when an American businessman brings his flapper daughter back to Poland with him? Nothing short of hilarity in this jolly romp starring delightful comedian Molly Picon. Watch as she teaches villagers to shimmy, breaks the Yom Kippur fast, and wins the heart of a Yeshiva scholar determined to return the favor. This madcap Austrian film captures the highly charged differences &#8211; and culture clashes &#8211; between Polish, American, and Austrian Jews in interwar Western Europe. <em>Introduced by Jan Schwarz, Professor of Yiddish at the University of Chicago.

    <strong></strong>
  <strong>Kiss </strong>&amp;<strong> Couch<br />
  </strong><em>Andy Warhol, 1963-4</em> &bull; These early films exemplify
some of Warhol&#8217;s mythic qualities &#8211; entire rolls of film simply shot and spliced together, themes of sexuality &#8211; while revealing that he channelled these attributes into the creation of deeply felt, exquisitely composed records of desire, not the vulgarity with which his films are often associated in the popular imagination. Kiss is a dozen or so three-minute takes of pairs kissing, with varying degrees of passion. Couch documents assorted Warhol associates &#8211; including Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac! &#8211; behaving both mundanely and pornographically on the Factory’s couch.</p>

    <strong>Iron Man</strong><br />
    <em>Jon Favreau, 2008</em> &bull; In a market glutted by comic book franchises well into or past their prime, Fravreau&#8217;s humble rendition of &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; is an unexpected surprise. Anchored by a screenplay that prefers tongue-in-cheek humor to heavy-handed histrionics, Robert Downey Jr. hams it up as the billionaire playboy Tony Stark. If his obligatory transformation into the conscientious crime fighter is less than convincing from a dramatic perspective, Favreau has smartly downplayed moral posturing in favor of low-key pathos. Jeff Bridges plays the snarling nemesis, and Gwyneth Paltrow the pouting heroine.</p>

    <strong>Forgetting Sarah Marshall<br />
    </strong><em>Nicholas Stoller, 2008</em> &bull; The Judd Apatow franchise (&#8220;40-Year Old Virgin&#8221;, &#8220;Knocked Up&#8221;, &#8220;Superbad&#8221;) expands with actor-writer (and Apatow regular) Jason Segel starring as a Hollywood score-writing schlep who loses his girlfriend (Krisen Bell) to a flashy, tightpantsed British rocker (Russell Brand). In a move recalling Private Lives, Segel and Bell end up at the same Hawaiian resort. There&#8217;s lots of nasty language, wonderfully dry turns from Brand, a motley crew of resort workers, and a running line about Segel&#8217;s Dracula musical. (And all the gratuitous full-frontal nudity you may have heard about.)</p>

    <strong>Moon Over Harlem<br />
    </strong><em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1939</em> &bull; This musical melodrama is set mainly in a Harlem nightclub featuring an all-black cast, a chorus, choir, and sixty-piece orchestra. Yet Ulmer claimed that shooting took four days, two for studio and two for location photography, a testament to his genius at negotiating tight budgets and poetic aspirations. An allegory of contemporary Harlem, the film is a tale of seduction and redemption, of a gangster named Dollar conning a wealthy widow, and marrying into her fortune. The widow&#8217;s daughter and her boyfriend, an idealistic community organizer, must transcend the evils Dollar has brought on their house.</p>

    <strong>Leaves from Satan&#8217;s Book<br />
    </strong><em>Carl Dreyer, 1921</em> &bull; The breakthrough film by one of the masters of cinema is a loose play on Intolerance, following the theme of temptation by the Devil, played by Helge Nissen, through four stories spanning nearly 2,000 years. The first story depicts Judas’s decision to betray Jesus, while Satan appears as the Grand Inquisitor in 16th century Spain in the second. The third vignette takes us to the French Revolution and the final story follows a Finnish woman in 1918 whose husband is away fighting the war. Dreyer&#8217;s incredible sense for composition and masterful use of close-ups are on display here in what was only his second feature. <em>Silent.</em></p>

    <strong>One on Top of the Other<br />
    </strong><em>Lucio Fulci, 1969</em> &bull; Before he entered his gore-film phase, Lucio Fulci started by directing spaghetti westerns, sex comedies, and murder mysteries; this superior giallo was his first. Soon after his asthmatic wife&#8217;s death, suave young doctor George Dumurrier (Euro heart-throb Jean Sorel) begins seeing a mysterious nightclub girl and prostitute who shares her exact features. Could she really be the reincarnation of his dead wife, or is a far more devious explanation behind the mystery? The film&#8217;s final 30 minutes, filmed on location in San Quentin Prison, rival the finale of Robert Wise’s I Want to Live in their nail-biting suspense.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

    <strong>The Magician<br />
  </strong><em>Ingmar Bergman, 1958</em> &bull; Bergman regular Max von Sydow stars as a traveling magician, widely known for a series of disturbing supernatural occurrences in his show &#8220;Vogler&#8217;s Magnetic Health Theater.&#8221; The town&#8217;s leading authorities are aware of these rumors and request a preview of his act. As they meet his magic with unwavering skepticism, the film offers a profound meditation on the relationship between the rational and the supernatural. Alternatively called The Face, this film is one of Bergman&#8217;s most unjustly neglected pictures from his early period. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <p>Thursday, October 9 &bull; 7:30 PM &bull; 72min<a name="NosnBeckerFortAheym" id="NosnBeckerFortAheym"></a><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/02Week/Yiddish_Nasn_Becker_Fort_Aheym.jpg" width="71" height="100" class="image" /><br />
      <strong>Nosn Becker Fort Aheym (The Return of Nathan Becker)</strong><br />
      <em>Boris Shpis &amp; Mark Milman, 1932</em> &bull; After 28 years laying bricks in the USA, Nosn escapes the Great Depression and returns home to the USSR. Unfortunately for him, he&#8217;s picked up some inefficient capitalist habits and has some learning to do before he can be a proper Soviet worker. Legendary Soviet Yiddish actor Solomon Mikhoels shines as Nosn&#8217;s father. The stinging critique of American racism adds yet another unexpected dimension to this remarkable film. Originally billed as &#8220;the first Yiddish talkie from Soviet Russia.&#8221; <em>Restored with new English subtitles, courtesy of <a href="http://www.jewishfilm.org" title="The National Center for Jewish Film" target="_self">The National Center for Jewish Film</a>.</em></p>

      <strong>Haircut No. 1 </strong>&amp;<strong> Eat </strong>&amp;<strong> Blowjob</strong><br />
      <em>Andy Warhol, 1963-4</em> &bull; These three chronicles of the ordinary &#8211; a haircut, a meal, a blowjob &#8211; are transformed under Warhol&#8217;s lens into perception-altering documents of the intimate and unseen. Haircut No. 1 emphasizes the sensuality that underlies all human physical interaction. Eat presents the consumption of a single mushroom by a hungry man as a stringently achronological adventure, with the main course appearing to shrink or grow with each reordered reel. Blow Job gives us thirty-five minutes of fellatio &#8211; as charted on the face of the receiver in intense, studied close-up.</p>
  <p>Friday, October 10 &bull; 7:00, 9:00 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 12 &bull; 1:00 PM &bull; 98min<a name="WALLE" id="WALLE"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/02Week/Weekend_Wall_E.jpg" width="101" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>WALL&bull;E</strong><br />
      <em>Andrew Stanton, 2008</em> &bull; Pixar&#8217;s latest hit is a delightful fairytale of the future with references to past animated hits and sci-fi classics. The obvious highlight of the film is the Waste Allocation &#8211; Earth class Robot, or &#8220;WALL&bull;E&#8221, a laborer on a deserted earth with touching humanness. WALL&bull;E labors to clean up Earth for the human race, but longs to have a robot companion. In the end, a famous Disney motif comes through to save WALL&bull;E and his friends, including love interest EVE, and in the process revives humanity. This is a 21st century fairy tale you and your kids will remember for years to come.</p>
  <p>Saturday, October 11 &bull; 6:30, 9:30 &amp; 11:30 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 12 &bull; 3:00 PM &bull; 120min<a name="HellboyII" id="HellboyII"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/02Week/Weekend_Hellboy_2.jpg" width="122" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</strong><br />
      <em>Guillermo Del Toro, 2008</em> &bull; When it was released in Spring 2004, Hellboy was eclipsed by Spiderman 2, but it developed a cult following for director Guillermo del Toro, who later solidified his reputation with the arty fantasy of his political allegory Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth. This time overshadowed by The Dark Knight, the Hellboy sequel has grossed less than the first, but cost more. Still, it’s a mess of fun. Del Toro invents a menagerie of weird things that &#8220;go bump in the night&#8221;, and there&#8217;s plenty of drama and poetry to go around from the noirish chemistry between the story&#8217;s unlikely lovers Hellboy and Young Liz.</p>

      <strong>Bluebeard</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1944</em> &bull; The first of three masterpieces Ulmer would make while working at the poverty row studio Producers Releasing Corporation, this Victorian Gothic potboiler, about a Parisian puppeteer whose search for the ideal beauty leads to the death by strangling of many a failed candidate, features John Carradine as the obsessed romantic lead, Gaston Morrel. The role was one of the esteemed character actor&#8217;s favorites, and displays him at his most commanding and sublime. The cinematography is by frequent Ulmer collaborator Eugen Sch&uuml;fftan, who achieves an atmosphere of luminous decadence.</p>
  <p>Monday, October 13 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 118m<a name="TalesofManhattan" id="TalesofManhattan"></a><br />
      <strong>Tales of Manhattan</strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/03Week/Omnibus_Tales_of_Manhattan.jpg" width="127" height="100" class="image" /><br />
      <em>Julien Duviver, 1942</em> &bull; One of just a handful of American films made by Julien Duvivier (P&eacute;p&eacute; le Moko), Tales of Manhattan follows a cursed tailcoat as it circulates among various New Yorkers – the working title was, in fact, Tails of Manhattan. Some of Hollywood&#8217;s top screenwriters penned the script, including Ben Hecht and Lamar Trotti, while the all-star cast features Rita Hayworth, Edward G. Robinson, Ginger Rogers, and Henry Fonda, just to name a few. Paul Robeson makes his final film appearance in the last story, though he publicly denounced the film&#8217;s portrayal of blacks upon its release.</p>
  <p>Tuesday, October 14 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 91m<a name="Paranoia" id="Paranoia"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/03Week/Giallo_Paranoia.jpg" width="128" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Paranoia</strong><br />
      <em>Umberto Lenzi, 1970</em>&bull; Umberto Lenzi, widely known for his infamous 1980 gut-muncher Cannibal Ferox, toiled away at more than his fair share of gialli too. One of his earliest, Paranoia features Carol Baker as a rich American widow looking for rest at an isolated Italian villa. However, the seductive but nefarious Lou Castel, who drags Baker down into a twisted spiral of drug-fueled orgies and twisted mind games, is out to prevent that. Like many early gialli, Paranoia is more about atmosphere and less about the graphic proto-slasher slayings that would later define the genre, though fans will still enjoy the occasional bloody flourish.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

    <strong>The Virgin Spring<br />
    </strong><em>Ingmar Bergman, 1960</em> &bull; In his first of many collaborations with master cinematographer Sven Nykvist, Bergman returns to medieval Sweden for this tale of a young peasant girl who is murdered in cold blood by two goat herders. The men seek shelter at the house of her pious father (Max von Sydow), who upon learning of their terrible deed seeks revenge at any cost. His piety and savage ruthlessness rage in conflict as he seeks to understand a God that could allow such evil to come upon his family. Curiously inspired Wes Craven&#8127;s 1972 horror classic <em>The Last House on the Left</em>. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles.</em></p>

    <strong>Motl der Operator (Motl the Operator)<br />
    </strong><em>Joseph Seiden, 1939</em> &bull; A tearjerking old-time melodrama reminiscent of the Second Avenue Yiddish theater scene and popular with the Jewish masses, Motl der Operator is an important historical document which illustrates the difficulties of the Jewish immigrant experience in New York City. Motl is a poor garment-worker who leads cloakmakers in a strike. When he is injured in a dispute with strikebreakers, his family is left in dire straits. Beautiful Yiddish songs heighten this bittersweet rendition of an archetypical Yiddish theater genre. <em>Introduced by Jan Schwarz, Professor of Yiddish at the University of Chicago.

      <strong>Sleep</strong><br />
      <em>Andy Warhol, 1963</em> &bull; &#8220;Sleep&#8221;, Warhol&#8217;s most radical exercise in stupendous, stupid duration this side of the eight-hour Empire, observes his lover, poet John Giorno, sleeping for five hours. It proceeds in repeated four-minute segments from assorted angles that distort and amplify the intensity of the gaze. <em>Sleep</em> can and perhaps should be experienced transiently &#8211; leaving and returning, watching in light of the world outside. &#8220;When people go to a show today they&#8217;re never involved any more,&#8221; Warhol observed; &#8220;A movie like <em>Sleep</em> gets them involved again. They get involved with themselves and they create their own entertainment.&#8221;</p>

      <strong>Mamma Mia!</strong><br />
      <em>Phyllida Lloyd, 2008 </em> &bull; Her wedding fast approaching, Sophie decides she wants her father to walk her down the aisle; problematically, he could be any one of three candidates: hunky Sam, proper Harry, or rugged Bill. Sophie deftly avoids emotional complication by inviting them all. Don&#8217;t worry if the plot sounds simple; Mamma Mia! is pure cinematic effervescence. Buttressed by delightful turns from Meryl Streep, gorgeous Greek location shooting, and a color palette bright enough to give Almodovar a run for his money, Mamma Mia! is a perfect summer throwback for a cold autumn weekend.</p>

    <strong>Kung-Fu Panda<br />
  </strong><em>Mark Osbourne &amp; John Stevenson, 2008</em> &bull; It&#8217;s a tale that resonates with people of every faith and nation: a clumsy, tubby panda strives to escape a life of work in his father&#8217;s noodle shop and become a world-class (but still tubby) martial artist. Armed with this premise and the voice talent of a cast including Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, and Dustin Hoffman, DreamWorks finally proves that Pixar isn&#8217;t the only worthwhile studio when it comes to CG animation.

    </strong><em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1945</em> &bull; Shortly before the release of <em>Bluebeard</em>, Ulmer began work on this most liberal of adaptations of <em>Hamlet</em> at PRC. Also photographed by Sch&uuml;fftan, the film elaborates the former work&#8217;s preoccupations with the atmospherics of madness. Ulmer&#8217;s Hamlet is the son of a deceased judge named Cartwright, whose delirious nightmares reveal to him an Oedipal figuration of sinister evil, claiming to be his new father. When that figure becomes a perverse reality, a child molesting serial murderer who aggressively courts the hero’s innocent mother, Ulmer can barely hide his delight at the ensuing Freudian morality play.</p>

While the studio&#8217;s previous omnibus efforts like <em>Tales of Manhattan</em> and <em>Flesh &amp; Fantasy</em> only featured one director, here a different filmmaker is at the helm for each story.

Could the menacing figure be related to an affair from her past, or another man looking to lead her astray in the present (genre regular George Hilton)? Stylishly directed by expert helmsman Sergio Martino, Victim epitomizes the stylish, jet-set milieu amongst which so many of these films were set, and features several suspenseful stalking sequences, including a nod to Psycho that ups the ante considerably in terms of onscreen carnage.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

    <strong>Smiles of a Summer Night<br />
    </strong><em>Ingmar Bergman, 1955</em> &bull; Although he had previously released 15 films to various acclaim, this film, while somewhat of an anomaly in his oeuvre, propelled Bergman to the international limelight. <em>Smiles of a Summer Night</em> is the charming story of four men and four women who spend a weekend together in the country at the turn of the century, a weekend filled with all the usual intrigue associated with switching partners. This film proves that Bergman&#8217;s genius extended to far more than the angst-ridden existential films that would occupy him for the rest of his career. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles.</em></p>

    <strong>Der Vanderner Yid (The Wandering Jew)<br />
    </strong>George Roland, 1933 &bull; The first American feature film and the only Yiddish-language film of the era to depict the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany, this unique film was made shortly after Hitler’s rise to power. It is the story of German-Jewish artist Arthur Levi, whose portrait of his Polish-born father is rejected by the Berlin Academy of Art. Later in the film, the portrait, titled The Eternal Wanderer, comes to life and leads Levi through the history of the persecution of the Jewish people. The film ends with an anti-Hitler rally in New York. <em>Introduced by Jan Schwarz, Professor of Yiddish at the University of Chicago.

The film gradually turns from scripted staging to Factory documentary, as the horse gets increasingly antsy and the cast begins to abandon the script, finally becoming more interested in playing S&amp;M than playing cowboy.

The all-star cast of Christian Bale returning as a more hardened Batman, Aaron Eckhart as &#8220;Gotham&#8217;s bright future,&#8221; D.A.

      <strong>The Garden</strong><br />
      <em>Scott Hamilton Kennedy, 2008</em> &bull; This award-winning documentary chronicles the complex and emotional story of the destruction of Los Angeles South Central Farm. Created from the ashes of the L.A. riots in 1992, the South Central Farm was the largest urban farm in the United States until its destruction in 2006. <em>The Garden</em> follows the farmers as they organize and launch an impassioned public battle to save the farm. The film documents the farmers&#8217; struggle against the city&#8217;s backroom deals, and  exposes the underlying issues of money, power, poverty and racial discord. The film explores the fault lines in American society, raising crucial and challenging questions about liberty, equality, and justice for the poorest and most vulnerable among us.

      <strong>Summer with Monika</strong><br />
      <em>Ingmar Bergman, 1953 </em>&bull; Woody Allen dragged his friends to Bergman&#8217;s 1953 feature hoping for a skin-flick. There is nudity but also lots more &#8211; Allen said that &#8220;nudity stopped being the reason we went as soon as we saw the movie.&#8221; For lots of other kids (and distributors) this lascivious Swedish film (about two working class youths on a summer jaunt off Stockholm&#8217;s shore) seemed scandalous enough to justify a long run in new art-house theaters. But Monika isn&#8217;t just an interesting artifact from the art house-years; it&#8217;s lively and (compared to Bergman&#8217;s later dour metaphysics) extremely watchable.</p>

    <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1946 </em>&bull; Alongside <em>The Black Cat</em>, this PRC thriller is Ulmer&#8217;s most celebrated film. Canonized as a film noir essential, the film sports a set-up, which recalls the clipped cynicism of such 30s fiction as <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em> (adapted the same year in a typically glossy MGM production starring John Garfield and Lana Turner). While hitchhiking west, a down-onhis- luck pianist becomes embroiled in a web of sex, murder and extortion. But Ulmer&#8217;s illusory treatment transcends the cheap premise, the six-day shooting schedule, and the $20,000 budget, to create a nightscape as disorienting as it is entrancing.</p>

  <strong>Le Plaisir</strong><br />
	<em>Max Ophuls, 1952</em> &bull; Ophuls&#8217;s melancholy follow-up to the stylistically similar La ronde is a rumination on the idea of pleasure adapted from three short stories by du Maupassant. Jean Galland plays an old man hiding behind a mask at a ball in the first vignette, while the second follows a brothel madame (Madeleine Renaud) and her girls on their outing to her niece&#8217;s first communion. The final segment tells the story of the deteriorating love between an artist (Daniel Gelin) and his model (Simone Simon). Upon its release, Jean-Luc Godard proclaimed <em>Le Plaisir</em> &#8220;the greatest film made in France since the Liberation.&#8221; <em>In French with English subtitles.</em></p>

After he confronts the man, the musician begins receiving mysterious packages, seeming to depict him murdering friends. Combining Argento&#8217;s interests in prog-rock, pseudo-science, and convoluted narrative into a heady cocktail, <em>4 Flies</em> is a key work in the Argento canon awaiting rediscovery.

    </strong><em>Ingmar Bergman, 1961</em> &bull; The first film in the so-called &#8220;Faith Trilogy,&#8221; <em>Through a Glass Darkly</em> is the story of Karin (Harriet Andersson), who returns home from a mental hospital but is still confronted with frequent delusions. While vacationing on a remote island, Karin is drawn deeper into her imagination as she comes closer to an experience with God. But although the title is a quote from the Bible, her God is more akin to Dostoevsky&#8217;s musings on the afterlife, when Svidrigailov asks in Crime and Punishment, &#8220;But what if there are only spiders there, or something like that?&#8221; <em>In Swedish with English subtitles.</em></p>

      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1937</em> &bull; Ulmer&#8217;s effort to create a new syle of &#8220;dignified&#8221; Yiddish film is laden with dreamy optimism and a soulful score. Filmed over just three days, this pastoral of life in the Eastern European shtetl remains one of the most beloved Yiddish talkies. Ascetic scholar Levi Yitskhok discovers true spirituality through earthy agrarianism in the midsummer countryside. Incorporating various currents of utopian thought, such as communalism, <em>Grine Felder</em> was popular with Communist and labor groups. <em>Introduced by Jan Schwarz, Professor of Yiddish at the University of Chicago.

      <em>Andy Warhol, 1965-6</em>  &bull; Poor Little Rich Girl &#8211; one of several talkies featuring Warhol&#8217;s homegrown Superstar, Edie Sedgwick &#8211; takes boredom as its subject: quotidian aspects of Edie&#8217;s life such as talking on the phone. As usual, the experience is productively and provocatively boring: the first reel, mostly out of focus, redefines human beauty and our ability to perceive it. The same is not quite true of another Superstar talkie, Hedy, but it&#8217;s just as much a dual portrait &#8211; of exotic Hollywood star Hedy Lamarr and of Mario Montez, the drag queen who plays her, recreating such scintillating moments as Lamarr&#8217;s shoplifting trial.</p>

      <em>Jia Zhang-Ke, 2006</em> &bull; This exploration of the dissoluble environment around the Three Gorges Dam is nothing less than a masterpiece. Jia articulates space in long takes and liquid pans, which respectively frame individuals and groups of figures against the Gorges&#8217; unearthly backdrops of industrial wasteland, and isolate bits of ephemera, such as cigarette packs, stop watches, and the like. These are the elements that make up Jia&#8217;s still life of Chinese culture caught in the flow of great leaps forward.<br />

One of the most notable is this Italian production featuring four short films by some of the masters of world cinema. Critical opinion appears to be divided over which segment is the strongest. Orson Welles gives a strong performance as the arrogant director of a biblical epic in Pasolini&#8217;s section, while Godard offers a preview of both the apartment scene from <em>Contempt</em> and of <em>Alphaville</em> as a whole in his. Rossellini and Gregoretti&#8217;s segments are similarly noteworthy.</p>

      <strong>What Have You Done to Solange?</strong><br />
      <em>Massimo Dallamano, 1972</em> &bull; A prime example of gothic-infused <em>giallo</em>, Dallamano&#8217;s film anticipates Argento&#8217;s <em>Suspiria</em> in its story of murders at an all-girls boarding school. A traumatic event in the past of troubled Solange holds the key to a series of brutal stabbings in the present. As with many <em>gialli</em>, <em>Solange</em> is steeped in psychoerotic trauma, particularly manifest in its infamous murders, which, while horrifyingly brutal, are depicted with admirable restraint. Featuring gorgeous cinematography by future Italian exploitation king Joe D&#8217;Amato, Dallamano&#8217;s film stands as one of the most engaging and easily-accessible of the <em>gialli</em>.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

      <em>Ingmar Bergman, 1962</em> &bull; Bergman continues his tortured examination of God and faith through the story of a priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who in the face of indifference among his congregation suffers a crisis of faith. He continues to faithfully perform his pastoral duties, but when he tries to pray he is greeted only by the sound of his own voice. A local schoolteacher (Maerta Lundberg) offers her love to him in an attempt to fill the void in his life, but he is overwhelmed by the emptiness he sees around him in a world marked by the absence of God. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles.</em></p>

      <em>Michael Waszynski, 1937</em> &bull; Betrothed before birth but separated by a father&#8217;s greed, a scholar and a maiden love each other with an intensity that is stronger than death. This classic film tells the story of a dybbuk, a spirit who possesses the body of his beloved. Inspired by an ethnographic expedition of Jewish life in Eastern Europe and inspired by interwar artistic movements, the Yiddish gothic film meticulously incorporates themes of money, social custom, and folklore in a parable of modernity. Keep an eye out for the &#8216;Dance of Death&#8217; by modern dance pioneer Judith Berg. <em>Introduced by Jan Schwarz, Professor of Yiddish at the University of Chicago.

      <strong>Taylor Mead&#8217;s Ass</strong> &amp; <strong>Shoulder</strong><br />
      <em>Andy Warhol, 1964</em> &bull; <em>Taylor Mead’s Ass</em> was inspired by an angry letter to the <em>Village Voice</em> that lamented filmmaker Jonas Mekas&#8217;s enthusiasm for an unnamed Warhol film that &#8220;focuses on Taylor Mead&#8217;s ass for two hours.&#8221; Despite these comic origins, the film goes beyond satire, turning what might have been self-parody into a work that exhausts, then expands the possibilities of the contemplating subject. Mead, who played equally significant roles in other Warhol films (including <em>Imitation of Christ</em>, 12/4), <em>Shoulder</em>, the preceding short, stars a body part too: the closely-framed shoulder of dancer Lucinda Childs. <em>Silent.</em></p>

      <strong>Sex and the City</strong><br />
      <em>Michael Patrick King, 2008</em> &bull; Carrie and Mr. Big are finally to get married, but it will take all of the film&#8217;s considerable length for the knot to be tied. As the couple plan, looking at apartments priced far beyond their means, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte grapple with their own problems: trust, fidelity, pregnancy. In its last hurrah, all the elements that made &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221; the quintessential &#8216;90s show return with a vengeance. There&#8217;s Manhattan, the Silvercup Studios, and the improbably perfect gowns, which grace our heroines&#8217; underpaid bodies. Fittingly, it all ends with a final round of cosmos.</p>

      <strong>Pineapple Express</strong><br />
      <em>David Gordon Green, 2008</em> &bull; Producer Judd Apatow has turned everything he&#8217;s touched in recent years to comedic and box office gold, as evidenced in smash hits <em>Superbad</em> and <em>Knocked Up</em>. His latest, <em>Pineapple Express</em>, won&#8217;t disappoint. Seth Rogen stars as a slacker/stoner who witnesses a murder, and turns to his dealer to help him cope. The dealer can only offer so much support, as it&#8217;s revealed that the murderer is, in fact, the only supplier of his rare &#8220;pineapple express&#8221; strain. Pot-addled antics ensue, skipping back and forth from high-powered action scenes to stoner humor.</p>

      <strong>The Strange Woman</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1946</em> &bull; This stormy melodrama of Hawthorne&#8217;s New England was, for once in Ulmer&#8217;s career, a bona fide A-picture, starring the voluptuous Hedy Lamarr as a working-class wench who sleeps her way to wealth and power in the fur traders&#8217; city of Bangor, Maine. On set, a baton-wielding Ulmer measured the rhythms of the diva&#8217;s delivery, slapping her legs if she broke time. The result is one of the most intense female performances in cinema, worthy of those Carl Dreyer achieved from Lisbeth Movin for <em>Day of Wrath</em>, and Nina Pens Rode for <em>Gertrud</em>, films to which <em>The Strange Woman</em> bears close relation.</p>

      <strong>Tales from the Crypt</strong><br />
      <em>Freddie Francis</em> &bull; The British pioneered the use of the omnibus format for horror films with the masterful Ealing production <em>Dead of Night</em>. In the mid-&#8216;60s, a company called Amicus Productions began to specialize in creating gory portmanteau films, sharing a great deal in common with Hammer Films in terms of its style and stars. As the Crypt Keeper, Ralph Richardson narrates five stories adapted from the <em>Tales From the Crypt</em> series by EC Comics. Other stars include Joan Collins and Peter Cushing. The film would later inspire an HBO series with the same name that aired in the 1990s.</p>

      <em>Sergio Martino, 1972</em> &bull; Another example of gothic <em>giallo</em>, All the Colors reunites director Martino with the ever-lovely Fenech as a fragile British housewife who finds herself pursued by a cult of devil-worshipers headed by sinister genre stalwart Ivan Rassimov. The film’s centerpiece is a stylish Satanic orgy trip-out, which, while clearly indebted to <em>Rosemary&#8217;s Baby</em>, still manages to beat that film at its own game of sheer stylistic excess. Between his gorgeous, color-gel-bathed compositions and expert use of Bruno Nicolai&#8217;s deliriously trippy score, Martino proves a master of the genre in one of its lesser-known treasures.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

      <strong>The Silence</strong><br />
      <em>Ingmar Bergman, 1963</em> &bull; The absence of God provides the context for the conclusion of the &#8220;Faith Trilogy,&#8221; in which Bergman turns his attention away from explicit questions about God&#8217;s existence and focuses on what the world might look like if void of his presence. <em>The Silence</em> is the story of two sisters (Ingrid Thulin and Gunnel Lindblom), one deathly ill with a lung disease and the other more concerned with sexual exploits than caring for her sister. Amidst the ruins of a war-torn country, they stop in a hotel and confront the vast emotional void that exists between them. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles.</em></p>

      <strong>Di Klyatsche (Fishke the Lame </strong> or <strong> The Light Ahead)</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1939</em> &bull; Ulmer&#8217;s most stylized Yiddish film is packed with aesthetic and political punch. Based on a story by the &#8220;Grandfather of Yiddish Literature,&#8221; <em>Di Klyatshe</em> is the only American Yiddish film with a negative view of the shtetl. When a cholera epidemic strikes the backward town of Glubsk, the superstitious town elders decide to marry off a blind orphan and a crippled bathhouse attendant in the cemetery at midnight. Visually a combination of Marc Chagall and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, this expressionist film turns the themes of Grine Felder upside-down. <em>Introduced by Jan Schwarz, Professor of Yiddish at the University of Chicago.

      <strong>John and Ivy </strong>&amp;<strong> The Closet</strong><br />
      <em>Andy Warhol, 1965-6</em> &bull; <em>John and Ivy</em> is a domestic drama of sorts, in which we observe the titular couple in their tiny apartment kitchen with the radio drowning out much of their speech as they enact the evening&#8217;s tasks and distractions. <em>The Closet</em> likewise concerns cramped spaces and relations, this time in the more absurd and existentially potent setting of a closet, in which Nico and a young Factory hand find themselves living. The two spend the duration of the film contemplating the contents of the closet, their sexual chemistry, and whether or not they should leave &#8211; but never manage to get anywhere in any of these endeavors.</p>

      <strong>The Wackness</strong><br />
      <em>Jonathan Levine, 2008</em> &bull; Set in New York City, 1994, <em>The Wackness</em> might seem like a return to simpler times, but such nostalgia is checked by reminders of life’s timeless difficulties, so easy to idealize in retrospect. A troubled teenage pot-dealer (Ben Peck) befriends an equally troubled psychologist (Ben Kingsley) during his last summer before college. Together they embark on explorations of self and city. Life pulsates from <em>The Wackness</em>, with its energetic hip-hop score. If it doesn&#8217;t leave you longing for the &#8216;90&#8217;s, it&#8217;ll remind wistfully of the melancholy that permeates youth&#8217;s long summer days.</p>

      <strong>The Naked Dawn</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1955</em> &bull; &#8220;It&#8217;s one of his few films in color, and perhaps the most perversely underpopulated western ever made &#8211; it seems to be taking place on Mars,&#8221; notes Dave Kehr, whose comments should give some idea of Ulmer&#8217;s radically unorthodox approach to the Western. Here, the landscape becomes an unearthly witness to an innocent young couple&#8217;s fall from grace when they encounter Santiago, a bandit who instructs them in rituals of lawlessness and corruption. A final scene signals crucifixion and redemption for the characters, who, like all Ulmer heroes, never waiver in the face of entrapping subjectivity.</p>

      <em>Ari Folman, 2008</em> &bull; This year&#8217;s film, <em>Waltz with Bashir</em>, is an animated documentary about the 1982 Lebanon war, in particular the massacre at the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps. At the center of the story is the writer/director himself, Ari Folman, who is trying to unblock his memory of these events and confront the Israeli failure to intervene. Rather than working in the genre of live-action documentary for which he is known, Folman has chosen to approach the horrors of the war in a combination of Flash, classic and 3-D animation. The film has been shown to much acclaim at this year&#8217;s Cannes and New York film festivals.

      <strong>Deep Red</strong><br />
      <em>Dario Argento, 1975</em> &bull; Vying with <em>Suspiria</em> for the title of Argento&#8217;s most famous film, <em>Deep Red</em> represents the epitome of <em>giallo</em> excess: outlandish plot contrivances, creepy characters (including a little girl who enjoys impaling lizards on pins), and Argento&#8217;s signature stylishly gory murders all add up to a masterpiece of the genre. Once again focusing on an artist inescapably drawn to investigate a brutal killing, <em>Deep Red</em> is anchored by fine performances from David Hemmings (star of Antonioni&#8217;s lauded proto-giallo <em>Blow-Up</em>) and Daria Nicolodi, Argento&#8217;s muse and future mother to the couple&#8217;s daughter, Asia.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

      <strong>Persona</strong><br />
      <em>Ingmar Bergman, 1966</em> &bull; Hailed by Susan Sontag as &#8220;an advance, in its emotional power and subtlety, over all his previous work,&#8221; Persona is if nothing else Bergman&#8217;s most enigmatic film. An actress (Liv Ullmann) becomes mute after a performance of Electra and is committed to the care of a young nurse (Bibi Andersson). What follows after the two women retreat to a beach house cannot be accurately described in terms of narrative, as the women&#8217;s identities and personalities are inexplicably split, exchanged, and intertwined, questioning the very nature of identity. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles</em>.</p>

      <em>Sidney M.

He oppresses his workers with 14-hour workdays, shows off his wealth, and convinces the impoverished Masha to marry him for her family&#8217;s sake, even though she really loves the Marxist labor organizer Charlie. &#8220;Schwartz&#8217;s Uncle Moses is a Jewish Godfather, vain and sleazy, ruthless yet sentimental &#8211; devoid of illusions, if not irony.&#8221; <em>Introduced by Jan Schwarz, Professor of Yiddish at the University of Chicago.

He gradually realizes that Warhol does not intend to make a simple screen test but a featurelength portrait drawn from little more than Geldzahler&#8217;s fidgeting acts, miniscule movements and nervous tics, as he grows increasingly agitated.

There&#8217;s nothing quite like a still-eligible Harrison Ford emerging from the shadows of a steamy studio jungle into a muscularly framed close-up. It&#8217;s a moment evocative of another star-making entrance shot, this one of John Wayne framed against Monument Valley.

      <em>Alex Holdridge, 2008</em> &bull; Confronted by the possibility of spending New Years Eve alone in L.A., Wilson (Scoot McNairy) is convinced by a friend to post a personal ad on Craigslist. Energetic and strong-willed Vivian (Sarah Simmonds) responds. Not sure what to expect from one another, together they spend the night roaming throughout the city.

      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1960</em> &bull; Shot over the same three-week period in Dallas as <em>Beyond the Time Barrier</em> (both productions employed make-shift sets provided by the Texas Fairground) this science-fiction thriller follows escaped convict Joey Faust, the accomplice of a crazed, former US army major, who plots to conquer the world with an army of invisible soldiers. It&#8217;s a spectacularly incoherent premise, which allows Ulmer free reign to create some striking sequences, such as Faust&#8217;s nocturnal flight from prison. Shooting day-for-night, Ulmer takes advantage of the dawn&#8217;s low-light levels to silhouette his figures against the environment.</p>

      <em>Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Alexander Kluge, et. al., 1978</em> &bull; In the fall of 1977, a German leftist group known as the RAF murdered an industrialist named Hanns-Martin Schleyer. Released with events still fresh on people&#8217;s minds, this film collage, which features a mix of documentary footage, fictionalized dramatizations, and news-report-style narration, attempts to capture both the political and social climate within the country at this tumultuous point in history. The movie&#8217;s many filmmakers include Alexander Kluge and Nobel laureate Heinrich B&ouml;ll, but arguably the candid contribution by Fassbinder is of the most interest.</p>

      <em>Armando Crispino, 1975</em> &bull; As the &#8216;70s wore on, <em>gialli</em> became increasingly outlandish and started taking their inspiration from unlikely sources. Armando Crispino&#8217;s 1975 outing Autopsy oddly but proudly echoes Tobe Hooper&#8217;s Texas Chain Saw Massacre in its opening credits, stock footage of exploding sun spots. Seemingly a result of these cosmic phenomena, a wave of suicides is overtaking Rome, which proves useful for medical student Simona, whose thesis is on the subject. However, when a beautiful young neighbor of hers is found dead, an apparent suicide, Simona decides that these deaths may not be suicides at all.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

      <strong>The Magic Flute</strong><br />
      <em>Ingmar Bergman, 1975</em> &bull; One of the most successful adaptations of opera to the screen, Bergman&#8217;s take on Mozart&#8217;s beloved <em>The Magic Flute</em> is more than just a staid filmed version of the opera. Bergman takes the familiar story of Tamino, Pamina, Papageno, Sarastro, and the Queen of the Night as his starting point, and merges the experience of the audience and the actual mechanics of the theater itself with the staged performance. Directing well over 100 plays, Bergman was even more prolific in theater than in film, but this film marks the only full intersection of the two. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles</em>.</p>

      <em>Edgar Gr. Ulmer, 1960</em> &bull; This sci-fi piece was produced to exploit the success that same year of George Pal&#8217;s <em>The Time Machine</em>. A pilot testing a new rocket-powered jet unwittingly breaks the time barrier! Returning to Earth, he finds it deserted and in disrepair, but struck unconscious, wakes up inside a pyramidal underground citadel whose sterile inhabitants want to use him to breed with their ruler&#8217;s daughter. The film&#8217;s sexual politics alone merit interest: all the women are dressed in short skirts and heels, only to be punished for their indiscretion by teeming mutants.

      <strong>Pieces</strong><br />
      <em>Juan Piquer Sim&oacute;n</em> &bull; A prime example of both the international influence held by the genre and its slow demise in the &#8216;80s, when it became confused with routine slashers, J.P. Sim&oacute;n&#8217;s American-set, Spanish-produced entry takes place on a Boston college campus, where a series of chainsaw murders have police stumped and the school&#8217;s administration&#8230; barely concerned. Pieces may be a notoriously bad pseudo-<em>giallo</em>, but it&#8217;s also a notoriously hilarious one. Produced by exploitation guru Dick Randall, Pieces is packed with lurid elements, from low-rent grue to the most gratuitous Bruce Lee impersonator ever to appear onscreen.<em> Introduced by Joe Rubin, cult film expert.</em></p>

      <strong>Autumn Sonata</strong><br />
      <em>Ingmar Bergman, 1978</em> &bull; The two great Bergmans pair up for the only time in their prolific careers in this film about an aging concert pianist (Ingrid Bergman) who after years of strain visits her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) in her home. Against the backdrop of Sven Nykvist&#8217;s gorgeous use of color, the mother and daughter attempt to resolve the pain that has separated them for so long. Autumn Sonata is the culmination of a decade long examination of the intricacies of pain and regret in relationships after putting the question of God to rest in <em>The Silence</em>. <em>In Swedish with English subtitles</em>.</p>

      <strong>Yankl der Shmid (The Singing Blacksmith)</strong><br />
      <em>Edgar G. Ulmer, 1938</em> &bull; Renowned cantor Moishe Oysher stars as the singing, dancing, womanizing blacksmith in a pioneering psychological exploration of physical desire. Lusty blacksmith Yankl loves his frail fiancée Tamara, despite her disapproving relations, but is tempted by a married woman. Like Grine Felder, this folk operetta celebrates village life, but the mores are much more secular &#8211; it even contains an example of Yiddish swing. Visually, it resembles Ulmer&#8217;s latter Hollywood expressionist noirs and thrillers. <em>Introduced by Jan Schwarz, Professor of Yiddish at the University of Chicago.

      <strong>Imitation of Christ</strong><br />
      <em>Andy Warhol, 1967</em> &bull; Said to have been inspired by a 15th century Catholic text of the same name, Imitation of Christ is a comedic &#8220;narrative film&#8221; like a number of Warhol&#8217;s other later works. The film is scripted, and was shot in San Francisco with a cast of Warhol regulars supporting former child actor Patrick Tilden in the role of the restless, youthful hippie protagonist. Tilden&#8217;s character wanders aimlessly through his city and his family life, apparently stoned and unfazed by the seductive advances of the family maid (played by Nico) or the concerned interjections of his parents (Ondine and Brigid Polk).</p>

      <strong>Tropic Thunder</strong><br />
      <em>Ben Stiller, 2008</em> &bull; With Robert Downey Jr. donning blackface to play a white actor making an arrogant career choice, Ben Stiller as an Oscarless has-been desperate for a comeback, and Jack Black as a Hollywood playboy in the throws of heroin withdrawal, Tropic Thunder&#8217;s comedic team packs a lot of punch. As this mess of characters attempts to make a Vietnam War film, over-the-top action sets a quick rhythm for the film’s relentless wit. Even while shamelessly breaking every rule of political correctness, Thunder is more than a procession of cheap shots, offering sharp satire of Hollywood throughout.</p>

      <strong>Hamlet 2</strong><br />
      <em>Andrew Fleming, 2008</em> &bull; Actor turned high school drama teacher Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) has already failed often in life when he decides that every good story deserves a sequel, and sets his rag-tag group of students to stage a musical follow-up to Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Hamlet</em>. The political incorrectness of his creation causes some community members to turn against it, but Marschz believes in the sanctity of artistic expression above all else, and works to ensure that the play will be staged, even getting the help of the ACLU. While maybe not quite comparable to the original, Hamlet 2 is surefire fun.</p>
