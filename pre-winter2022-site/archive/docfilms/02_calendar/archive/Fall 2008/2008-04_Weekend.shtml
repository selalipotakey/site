<h1> Fall 2008, Weekend Schedule </h1>
  <p>Friday, October 3 &bull; 6:30, 9:00 &amp 11:30 PM &bull; Matinee, Sunday, October 5 &bull; 3:30 PM &bull; 126min<a name="IronMan" id="IronMan"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/01Week/Weekend_Ironman.jpg" width="133" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    <strong>Iron Man</strong><br />
    <em>Jon Favreau, 2008</em> &bull; In a market glutted by comic book franchises well into or past their prime, Fravreau&#8217;s humble rendition of &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; is an unexpected surprise. Anchored by a screenplay that prefers tongue-in-cheek humor to heavy-handed histrionics, Robert Downey Jr. hams it up as the billionaire playboy Tony Stark. If his obligatory transformation into the conscientious crime fighter is less than convincing from a dramatic perspective, Favreau has smartly downplayed moral posturing in favor of low-key pathos. Jeff Bridges plays the snarling nemesis, and Gwyneth Paltrow the pouting heroine.</p>
  <p>Saturday, October 4 &bull; 6:30, 9:00 &amp; 11:30 &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 5 &bull; 1:00 PM &bull; 112min<a name="ForgettingSarahMarshall" id="ForgettingSarahMarshall"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/01Week/Weekend_Forgetting_Sarah_Marshall.jpg" width="150" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    <strong>Forgetting Sarah Marshall<br />
    </strong><em>Nicholas Stoller, 2008</em> &bull; The Judd Apatow franchise (&#8220;40-Year Old Virgin&#8221;, &#8220;Knocked Up&#8221;, &#8220;Superbad&#8221;) expands with actor-writer (and Apatow regular) Jason Segel starring as a Hollywood score-writing schlep who loses his girlfriend (Krisen Bell) to a flashy, tightpantsed British rocker (Russell Brand). In a move recalling Private Lives, Segel and Bell end up at the same Hawaiian resort. There&#8217;s lots of nasty language, wonderfully dry turns from Brand, a motley crew of resort workers, and a running line about Segel&#8217;s Dracula musical. (And all the gratuitous full-frontal nudity you may have heard about.)</p>
  
  <p>Friday, October 10 &bull; 7:00, 9:00 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 12 &bull; 1:00 PM &bull; 98min<a name="WALLE" id="WALLE"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/02Week/Weekend_Wall_E.jpg" width="101" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>WALL&bull;E</strong><br />
      <em>Andrew Stanton, 2008</em> &bull; Pixar&#8217;s latest hit is a delightful fairytale of the future with references to past animated hits and sci-fi classics. The obvious highlight of the film is the Waste Allocation &#8211; Earth class Robot, or &#8220;WALL&bull;E&#8221, a laborer on a deserted earth with touching humanness. WALL&bull;E labors to clean up Earth for the human race, but longs to have a robot companion. In the end, a famous Disney motif comes through to save WALL&bull;E and his friends, including love interest EVE, and in the process revives humanity. This is a 21st century fairy tale you and your kids will remember for years to come.</p>
  <p>Saturday, October 11 &bull; 6:30, 9:30 &amp; 11:30 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 12 &bull; 3:00 PM &bull; 120min<a name="HellboyII" id="HellboyII"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/02Week/Weekend_Hellboy_2.jpg" width="122" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</strong><br />
      <em>Guillermo Del Toro, 2008</em> &bull; When it was released in Spring 2004, Hellboy was eclipsed by Spiderman 2, but it developed a cult following for director Guillermo del Toro, who later solidified his reputation with the arty fantasy of his political allegory Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth. This time overshadowed by The Dark Knight, the Hellboy sequel has grossed less than the first, but cost more. Still, it’s a mess of fun. Del Toro invents a menagerie of weird things that &#8220;go bump in the night&#8221;, and there&#8217;s plenty of drama and poetry to go around from the noirish chemistry between the story&#8217;s unlikely lovers Hellboy and Young Liz.</p>
  <p>Friday, October 17 &bull; 6:30, 8:45 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 19 &bull; 1:00 PM &bull; 108min<a name="MammaMia" id="MammaMia"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/03Week/Weekend_Mamma_Mia.jpg" width="132" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Mamma Mia!</strong><br />
      <em>Phyllida Lloyd, 2008 </em> &bull; Her wedding fast approaching, Sophie decides she wants her father to walk her down the aisle; problematically, he could be any one of three candidates: hunky Sam, proper Harry, or rugged Bill. Sophie deftly avoids emotional complication by inviting them all. Don&#8217;t worry if the plot sounds simple; Mamma Mia! is pure cinematic effervescence. Buttressed by delightful turns from Meryl Streep, gorgeous Greek location shooting, and a color palette bright enough to give Almodovar a run for his money, Mamma Mia! is a perfect summer throwback for a cold autumn weekend.</p>
  <p>Saturday, October 18 &bull; 7:00, 9:00 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 19 &bull; 3:30 AM &bull; 92min <a name="KungFuPanda" id="KungFuPanda"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/03Week/Weekend_Kung_Fu_Panda.jpg" width="178" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    <strong>Kung-Fu Panda<br />
  </strong><em>Mark Osbourne &amp; John Stevenson, 2008</em> &bull; It&#8217;s a tale that resonates with people of every faith and nation: a clumsy, tubby panda strives to escape a life of work in his father&#8217;s noodle shop and become a world-class (but still tubby) martial artist. Armed with this premise and the voice talent of a cast including Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, and Dustin Hoffman, DreamWorks finally proves that Pixar isn&#8217;t the only worthwhile studio when it comes to CG animation. Watch for James Baxter&#8217;s absolutely gorgeous opening sequence, inspired by Chinese shadow puppetry. As the tagline says: Prepare for Awesomeness!</p>
  <p>Friday, October 24 &bull; 6:30 &amp; 10:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 26 &bull; 3:00 PM &bull; 152min <a name="TheDarkKnight" id="TheDarkKnight"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/04Week/Weekend_Dark_Knight.jpg" width="235" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
  <strong>The Dark Knight<br />
  </strong>Christopher Nolan, 2008 <em> </em>&bull;In this much anticipated sequel to Batman Begins, Nolan doesn&#8217;t just live up to high expectations, but shatters them, in what is arguably the darkest, most sophisticated, and best comic book film ever made. The all-star cast of Christian Bale returning as a more hardened Batman, Aaron Eckhart as &#8220;Gotham&#8217;s bright future,&#8221; D.A. Harvey Dent, and Heath Ledger as a deranged, psychopathic Joker that completely departs from Jack Nicholson&#8217;s more purely comedic portrayal, offers up a gripping, intensely troubling film.</p>
  <p>Saturday, October 25 &bull; 7:00, 9:00 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 26 &bull; 1:00 PM &bull; 96min<a name="SummerwithMonika" id="SummerwithMonika"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/04Week/Weekend_Sommaren_med_Monika.jpg" width="134" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Summer with Monika</strong><br />
      <em>Ingmar Bergman, 1953 </em>&bull; Woody Allen dragged his friends to Bergman&#8217;s 1953 feature hoping for a skin-flick. There is nudity but also lots more &#8211; Allen said that &#8220;nudity stopped being the reason we went as soon as we saw the movie.&#8221; For lots of other kids (and distributors) this lascivious Swedish film (about two working class youths on a summer jaunt off Stockholm&#8217;s shore) seemed scandalous enough to justify a long run in new art-house theaters. But Monika isn&#8217;t just an interesting artifact from the art house-years; it&#8217;s lively and (compared to Bergman&#8217;s later dour metaphysics) extremely watchable.</p>
  <p>Friday, October 31 &bull; 6:30 &amp; 8:45 PM &bull; 104min <a name="XFiles" id="XFiles"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/05Week/Weekend_X_Files.jpg" width="80" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    <strong>X-Files: I Want to Believe</strong><br />
    <em>Chris Carter, 2008</em> &bull; The mysterious kidnapping of a woman brings Mulder &amp; Scully out of retirement to solve the case. After more abductions, the actions of a former priest (and psychic), come into question. Conflicts with other FBI agents impede our favorite paranormal investigating duo. But never mind all of that, will Scully and Mulder ever get it on? Don&#8217;t miss the Dubya joke.</p>
	<p><em>***SPECIAL MIDNIGHT SCREENING***</em><br />
	Friday, October 31 &bull; 11:59 PM &bull; 109min<br />
	<strong>The Thing</strong><br />
	<em>John Carpenter, 1982</em> &bull; Join us for the Third Annual Doc Films Halloween Midnight Costume Contest and screening of John Carpenter&#8217;s <em>The Thing</em>.</p>
    <p>Saturday, November 1 &bull; 7:00, 9:00 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, November 2 &bull; 90min<a name="StealingAmerica" id="StealingAmerica"></a><br />
      <strong>Stealing America: Vote by Vote</strong><br />
      <em>Dorothy Fadiman, 2008</em> &bull; As we&#8217;re all getting riled up to take part in the democratic process of &#8216;08, <em>Stealing America</em> warns us of all the problems in that process, particularly those brought about with the growing use of electronic voting, and how those problems affected the results in the 2000 and 2004 elections. While perhaps formally clumsy at times, director Fadiman provides a passionate perspective on an important issue that most political players seem content to ignore. Regardless of who you plan to vote for on Tuesday, <em>Stealing America</em>&#8217;s warnings of how it may (not) count will stir you.</p>
<p>November 7 &bull; 7:00 &amp; 10:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, October 9 &bull; 3:15 &bull; 148min<a name="SexandtheCity" id="SexandtheCity"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/06Week/Weekend_Sex_and_the_City.jpg" width="78" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Friday, Sex and the City</strong><br />
      <em>Michael Patrick King, 2008</em> &bull; Carrie and Mr. Big are finally to get married, but it will take all of the film&#8217;s considerable length for the knot to be tied. As the couple plan, looking at apartments priced far beyond their means, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte grapple with their own problems: trust, fidelity, pregnancy. In its last hurrah, all the elements that made &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221; the quintessential &#8216;90s show return with a vengeance. There&#8217;s Manhattan, the Silvercup Studios, and the improbably perfect gowns, which grace our heroines&#8217; underpaid bodies. Fittingly, it all ends with a final round of cosmos.</p>
<p>November 8 &bull; 6:30, 9:00 &amp; 11:30 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, November 9 &bull; 1:00 &bull; 111min<a name="PineappleExpresses" id="PineappleExpress"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/06Week/Weekend_Pineapple_Express.jpg" width="150" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Saturday, Pineapple Express</strong><br />
      <em>David Gordon Green, 2008</em> &bull; Producer Judd Apatow has turned everything he&#8217;s touched in recent years to comedic and box office gold, as evidenced in smash hits <em>Superbad</em> and <em>Knocked Up</em>. His latest, <em>Pineapple Express</em>, won&#8217;t disappoint. Seth Rogen stars as a slacker/stoner who witnesses a murder, and turns to his dealer to help him cope. The dealer can only offer so much support, as it&#8217;s revealed that the murderer is, in fact, the only supplier of his rare &#8220;pineapple express&#8221; strain. Pot-addled antics ensue, skipping back and forth from high-powered action scenes to stoner humor.</p>
<p>Friday, November 14 &bull; 7:00, 9:00 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, November 16 &bull; 1:00 PM &bull; 96min<a name="VickyChristinaBarcelona" id="VickyChristinaBarcelona"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/07Week/Weekend_Vicky_Christina.jpg" width="150" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Vicky Christina Barcelona</strong><br />
      <em>Woody Allen, 2008</em> &bull; After working successfully with her in <em>Scoop</em> and <em>Matchpoint</em>, Woody Allen couldn&#8217;t help but bring back Scarlet Johansson for yet another story of European drama and passion. Javier Bardem plays artist and seducer Juan Antonio, who steps into the lives of two Americans spending the summer in Barcelona: the reserved and practical Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and the sexually liberated Cristina (Johansson). Enter one ravishingly beautiful, but unstable ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), and hilarity and trauma dance around as the cast weaves an increasingly complicated romantic web.</p>
<p>Saturday, November 15 &bull; 7:00, 9:00 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, November 16 &bull; 3:00 PM &bull; 95min<a name="TheWackness" id="TheWackness"><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/07Week/Weekend_The_Wackness.jpg" width="133" height="100" class="image" /></strong></a><br />
      <strong>The Wackness</strong><br />
      <em>Jonathan Levine, 2008</em> &bull; Set in New York City, 1994, <em>The Wackness</em> might seem like a return to simpler times, but such nostalgia is checked by reminders of life’s timeless difficulties, so easy to idealize in retrospect. A troubled teenage pot-dealer (Ben Peck) befriends an equally troubled psychologist (Ben Kingsley) during his last summer before college. Together they embark on explorations of self and city. Life pulsates from <em>The Wackness</em>, with its energetic hip-hop score. If it doesn&#8217;t leave you longing for the &#8216;90&#8217;s, it&#8217;ll remind wistfully of the melancholy that permeates youth&#8217;s long summer days.</p>
<p>Friday, November 21 &bull; 6:30, 9:00 &amp; 11:30 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, November 23 &bull; 1:00 &bull; 115min<a name="RaidersoftheLostArk" id="RaidersoftheLostArk"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/08Week/Weekend_Raiders.jpg" width="66" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Raiders of the Lost Ark</strong><br />
      <em>Steven Spielberg, 1981</em> &bull; As antidote to Lucas and Spielberg&#8217;s most recent installment, Doc is delighted to present the inaugural Indy film. There&#8217;s nothing quite like a still-eligible Harrison Ford emerging from the shadows of a steamy studio jungle into a muscularly framed close-up. It&#8217;s a moment evocative of another star-making entrance shot, this one of John Wayne framed against Monument Valley. Heavies (Aryan and non-Aryan), snakes, evil monkeys, sidekicks (good and bad), pirates, the ark of the covenant and government cover-ups &#8211; how could &#8220;The Crystal Skull&#8221; even rate?</p>
<p>Saturday, November 22 &bull; 7:00, 9:00 &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, November 23 &bull; 3:00 &bull; 90min<a name="InSearchofaMidnightKiss" id="InSearchofaMidnightKiss"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/08Week/Weekend_In_Search_of_a_Midnight_Kiss.jpg" width="178" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>In Search of a Midnight Kiss</strong><br />
      <em>Alex Holdridge, 2008</em> &bull; Confronted by the possibility of spending New Years Eve alone in L.A., Wilson (Scoot McNairy) is convinced by a friend to post a personal ad on Craigslist. Energetic and strong-willed Vivian (Sarah Simmonds) responds. Not sure what to expect from one another, together they spend the night roaming throughout the city. As midnight approaches, both find themselves engaged in unfamiliar and refreshing levels of emotional honesty. <em>Midnight Kiss</em> is a true indie gem, as tender as it is quirky, and truly touching as an antidote to the tired formula of the Hollywood romantic comedy.</p>
	  <p>Friday, December 5 &bull; 6:30, 8:45, &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, December 7 &bull; 3:00 &bull; 107min<a name="TropicThunder" id="TropicThunder"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/10Week/Weekend_Tropic_Thunder.jpg" width="150" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Tropic Thunder</strong><br />
      <em>Ben Stiller, 2008</em> &bull; With Robert Downey Jr. donning blackface to play a white actor making an arrogant career choice, Ben Stiller as an Oscarless has-been desperate for a comeback, and Jack Black as a Hollywood playboy in the throws of heroin withdrawal, Tropic Thunder&#8217;s comedic team packs a lot of punch. As this mess of characters attempts to make a Vietnam War film, over-the-top action sets a quick rhythm for the film’s relentless wit. Even while shamelessly breaking every rule of political correctness, Thunder is more than a procession of cheap shots, offering sharp satire of Hollywood throughout.</p>
	  <p>Saturday, December 3 &bull; 7:00, 9:00, &amp; 11:00 PM &bull; Matinee Sunday, December 6 &bull; 1:00 &bull; 92min<a name="Hamlet2" id="Hamlet2"></a><br />
      <strong>Hamlet 2</strong><br />
      <em>Andrew Fleming, 2008</em> &bull; Actor turned high school drama teacher Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) has already failed often in life when he decides that every good story deserves a sequel, and sets his rag-tag group of students to stage a musical follow-up to Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Hamlet</em>. The political incorrectness of his creation causes some community members to turn against it, but Marschz believes in the sanctity of artistic expression above all else, and works to ensure that the play will be staged, even getting the help of the ACLU. While maybe not quite comparable to the original, Hamlet 2 is surefire fun.</p>
