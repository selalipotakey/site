<h1> Fall 2008, Tuesday Series &bull; Gialli: Italian Thrillers </h1>

<p><em>Stylish and gory murder mysteries from the swinging &#8217;70s</em></p>

<p>Italian for &#8220;yellow,&#8221; <em>Giallo</em> was a term originally identified with lurid paperback thrillers that attempted to attract shoppers&#8217; attention with their bright yellow covers, often depicting scantily-clad women in peril. In the &#8217;60s, this genre began its migration to film, with Mario Bava&#8217;s <em>The Girl who Knew too Much</em> credited as the first cinematic example of a <em>giallo</em>. As is all too typical in Italian genre cinema, the success of this initial outing quickly inspired a spate of follow-ups and imitators. <strong><A href="#essay" onclick="toggle_visibility('essay');">more</a></strong></p>

<div id="essay" style="display:none;">

<p>Perhaps one of the most seminal of all <em>gialli</em>, Dario Argento&#8217;s debut, <strong><em><a href="#BirdwiththeCrystalPlumage">Bird with the Crystal Plumage</a></em></strong> (9/30) rocketed its director to national &#8211; and even international &#8211; stardom and instantly cemented his reputation as &#8220;the Italian Hitchcock.&#8221; Centering around an American writer in Rome who gets tied up in a murder case, Argento&#8217;s film lays the groundwork for almost every giallo to come &#8211; a social outsider witnessing a brutal murder and subsequently immersing him- (or her-) -self in the case, homicidal impulses motivated by bizarre psychosexual trauma, stylized and baroque murder set-pieces, bizarre and discordant scoring, and garish architecture all figure into the film (as in the many <em>gialli</em> to follow); however, no one managed to combine these elements quite as fluidly as Argento did at his peak, and Bird provides a prime example of his talent.</p> 

<p>While it&#8217;s hard to dispute Argento&#8217;s place atop the <em>giallo</em> pantheon, several directors managed to favorably go up against him at some point in their careers. One such shining example is Lucio Fulci&#8217;s <strong><em><a href="#OneonTopoftheOther">One on top of the Other</a></em></strong>, aka <strong><em><a href="#OneonTopoftheOther">Perversion Story</a></em></strong> (10/7), a stylish thriller that eschews the usual giallo violence while embracing its overt sexuality and penchant for garish set-pieces. In particular, keep an eye out for a sex scene viewed from the perspective of the bed and a stunning striptease featuring Marisa Mell bathed in more color gels than a castmember in a <em><a href="Weekend08-04.shtml#MammaMia">Mamma Mia!</a></em> (showing at Doc on Friday 10/17) dance number. Beyond Fulci, the genre found several other luminaries in Umberto Lenzi (<strong><em><a href="#Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em></strong>, 10/14), whose surprisingly elegant entries in the genre belie his future as the director of some of Italy&#8217;s most controversial cannibal films, and Sergio Martino (<strong><em><a href="#TheStrangeViceofMrsWardh">Next!</a></em></strong>, aka <strong><em><a href="#TheStrangeViceofMrsWardh">The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh</a></em></strong>, 10/21, and <strong><em><a href="#AlltheColorsoftheDark">All the Colors of the Dark</a></em></strong>, 11/11), who, along with the gorgeous Italo-Algerian actress Edwige Fenech, created some of the sexiest and most clever of the <em>gialli</em>. 

Indeed, well through the &#8217;70s things showed no signs of slowing down, and the <em>giallo</em> remained a hit both at home and abroad. Bolstered by the international success of <em>Bird</em>, Argento smartly used the first film as a stepping-off point for a loose trilogy, which he concluded with the comedic-surreal <strong><em><a href="#4FliesonGrayVelvet">4 Flies on Gray Velvet</a></em></strong> (10/28). Less popular internationally than the series&#8217; preceding two entries, the film is now one of Argento&#8217;s most neglected works, owing primarily to lack of any decent home video release; luckily, Doc has secured a fine print of this near-lost classic, which should make October 28 a can’t-miss evening for Argentophiles.</p> 

<p>Because we just can&#8217;t get enough of him, Argento returns on November 18 with 1975&#8217;s <strong><em><a href="#DeepRed">Deep Red</a></em></strong> (11/18), a film many consider his masterpiece. Combining the baroque stylings of <em>Bird</em> with even more outr&eacute; elements, <em>Deep Red</em> was a hit both in its native Italy and internationally, notably playing for years in US driveins and on the grindhouse circuit, a market understandably fond of the <em>giallo</em>&#8217;s excesses. Along with <em>Deep Red</em>, Doc presents several other perennial grindhouse favorites, including Massimo Dallamano&#8217;s stylish <strong><em><a href="#WhatHaveYouDonetoSolange">What Have You Done to Solange?</a></em></strong> (aka <strong><em><a href="#WhatHaveYouDonetoSolange">The School That Couldn’t Scream</a></em></strong>, 11/4) and Armando Crispino&#8217;s delightfully lurid <strong><em><a href="#Autopsy">Autopsy</a></em></strong> (11/25).</p>

<p>As the &#8217;70s drew to a close, so did the life of the giallo, though the genre would continue to hold a fair deal of sway for several more years. Nevertheless, the popularization of the post-Halloween slasher flick was quickly proving a corroding influence on the genre, which had already been treading dangerously close to the American slasher for many years. Perhaps no film stands as better testament to this than Juan Piquer Simon&#8217;s hilarious Spanish giallo wannabe, <strong><em><a href="#Pieces">Pieces</a></em></strong> (12/2). Ostensibly a standard giallo-style whodunit, the film is nevertheless heavily indebted to a more American brand of horror, as evidenced both by its tagline, &#8220;You Don&#8217;t Have to go to Texas for a Chainsaw Massacre!,&#8221; and its being set at an American college campus. Still, if the film is beholden to anything, it is blatant commercialism itself, as Simon assaults his audience with every commercial element he can throw at them &#8211; rampant nudity (from both sexes), gory &#8211; if cut-rate &#8211; chainsaw killings, and even an utter non-sequitur appearance by a Bruce Lee impersonator during a suspenseful chase scene. Barely a thriller but one hell of a good time, <em>Pieces</em> can be seen as a perfect end to an infamously manic genre &#8211; over-the-top, delirious, and always entertaining. <strong>JK</strong> <strong><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('essay');">close</a></strong></p></div>

      <strong>Bird with the Crystal Plumage</strong><br />
    <em>Dario Argento, 1969 &bull; </em>Dario Argento&#8217;s seminal <em>giallo</em> wasn&#8217;t the first, but it was the film to truly popularize the craze, with subsequent films obsessively copying its suspenseful stalking scenes as well as its [animal]-[adjective]-[noun] title. Setting the bar high in terms of the genre&#8217;s baroque theatrics, Bird finds handsome young American artist Tony Musante witnessing an attempted murder while trapped between panes of glass in the entryway to an art gallery. Drawn increasingly deeper into the case, Musante comes to discover that there was more to this situation than initially met the eye. </p>
  
  <p>Tuesday, October 7 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 97min<a name="OneonTopoftheOther" id="OneonTopoftheOther"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/02Week/Giallo_One_on_Top_of_the_Other.jpg" width="182" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
    <strong>One on Top of the Other<br />
    </strong><em>Lucio Fulci, 1969</em> &bull; Before he entered his gore-film phase, Lucio Fulci started by directing spaghetti westerns, sex comedies, and murder mysteries; this superior giallo was his first. Soon after his asthmatic wife&#8217;s death, suave young doctor George Dumurrier (Euro heart-throb Jean Sorel) begins seeing a mysterious nightclub girl and prostitute who shares her exact features. Could she really be the reincarnation of his dead wife, or is a far more devious explanation behind the mystery? The film&#8217;s final 30 minutes, filmed on location in San Quentin Prison, rival the finale of Robert Wise’s I Want to Live in their nail-biting suspense.</p>
  
  <p>Tuesday, October 14 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 91m<a name="Paranoia" id="Paranoia"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/03Week/Giallo_Paranoia.jpg" width="128" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Paranoia</strong><br />
      <em>Umberto Lenzi, 1970</em>&bull; Umberto Lenzi, widely known for his infamous 1980 gut-muncher Cannibal Ferox, toiled away at more than his fair share of gialli too. One of his earliest, Paranoia features Carol Baker as a rich American widow looking for rest at an isolated Italian villa. However, the seductive but nefarious Lou Castel, who drags Baker down into a twisted spiral of drug-fueled orgies and twisted mind games, is out to prevent that. Like many early gialli, Paranoia is more about atmosphere and less about the graphic proto-slasher slayings that would later define the genre, though fans will still enjoy the occasional bloody flourish. </p>
  <p>Tuesday, October 21 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 98min<a name="TheStrangeViceofMrsWardh" id="TheStrangeViceofMrsWardh"></a><br />
      <strong>The Strange Vice of Ms. Wardh</strong><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/04Week/Giallo_The_Strange_Vice_of_Mrs_Wardh.jpg" width="237" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <em>Sergio Martino, 1971</em> &bull; Bored politician&#8217;s wife Julie Wardh (the gorgeous Edwige Fenech) is menaced by a mysterious stranger who holds a few secrets that she wants kept hidden. Could the menacing figure be related to an affair from her past, or another man looking to lead her astray in the present (genre regular George Hilton)? Stylishly directed by expert helmsman Sergio Martino, Victim epitomizes the stylish, jet-set milieu amongst which so many of these films were set, and features several suspenseful stalking sequences, including a nod to Psycho that ups the ante considerably in terms of onscreen carnage.</p>
  <p> Tuesday, October 28 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 104min<a name="4FliesonGrayVelvet" id="4FliesonGrayVelvet"></a><br />
      <strong>4 Flies on Gray Velvet</strong><br />
      <em>Dario Argento, 1971</em> &bull; The final entry in Argento&#8217;s &#8220;animal trilogy,&#8221; <em>4 Flies</em> follows a young rock musician being menaced by a mysterious stranger. After he confronts the man, the musician begins receiving mysterious packages, seeming to depict him murdering friends. Combining Argento&#8217;s interests in prog-rock, pseudo-science, and convoluted narrative into a heady cocktail, <em>4 Flies</em> is a key work in the Argento canon awaiting rediscovery. Plagued by rights issues since its initial release and long unavailable on DVD, join Doc for a rare presentation of Argento&#8217;s lost masterpiece as it was meant to be seen &#8211; on the big screen. </p>
<p>Tuesday, November 4 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 102min<a name="WhatHaveYouDonetoSolange" id="WhatHaveYouDonetoSolange"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/06Week/Giallo_What_Have_You_Done_to_Solange.jpg" width="70" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>What Have You Done to Solange?</strong><br />
      <em>Massimo Dallamano, 1972</em> &bull; A prime example of gothic-infused <em>giallo</em>, Dallamano&#8217;s film anticipates Argento&#8217;s <em>Suspiria</em> in its story of murders at an all-girls boarding school. A traumatic event in the past of troubled Solange holds the key to a series of brutal stabbings in the present. As with many <em>gialli</em>, <em>Solange</em> is steeped in psychoerotic trauma, particularly manifest in its infamous murders, which, while horrifyingly brutal, are depicted with admirable restraint. Featuring gorgeous cinematography by future Italian exploitation king Joe D&#8217;Amato, Dallamano&#8217;s film stands as one of the most engaging and easily-accessible of the <em>gialli</em>.</p>
<p>Tuesday, November 11 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 88min<a name="AlltheColorsoftheDark" id="AlltheColorsoftheDark"></a><br />
      <strong>All the Colors of the Dark</strong><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/07Week/Giallo_All_the_Colors_of_the_Dark.jpg" width="228" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <em>Sergio Martino, 1972</em> &bull; Another example of gothic <em>giallo</em>, All the Colors reunites director Martino with the ever-lovely Fenech as a fragile British housewife who finds herself pursued by a cult of devil-worshipers headed by sinister genre stalwart Ivan Rassimov. The film’s centerpiece is a stylish Satanic orgy trip-out, which, while clearly indebted to <em>Rosemary&#8217;s Baby</em>, still manages to beat that film at its own game of sheer stylistic excess. Between his gorgeous, color-gel-bathed compositions and expert use of Bruno Nicolai&#8217;s deliriously trippy score, Martino proves a master of the genre in one of its lesser-known treasures.</p>
<p>Tuesday, November 18 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 98min<a name="DeepRed" id="DeepRed"></a><strong><img src="../06_media/2008-04_images/08Week/Giallo_Deep_Red.jpg" width="72" height="100" class="image" /></strong><br />
      <strong>Deep Red</strong><br />
      <em>Dario Argento, 1975</em> &bull; Vying with <em>Suspiria</em> for the title of Argento&#8217;s most famous film, <em>Deep Red</em> represents the epitome of <em>giallo</em> excess: outlandish plot contrivances, creepy characters (including a little girl who enjoys impaling lizards on pins), and Argento&#8217;s signature stylishly gory murders all add up to a masterpiece of the genre. Once again focusing on an artist inescapably drawn to investigate a brutal killing, <em>Deep Red</em> is anchored by fine performances from David Hemmings (star of Antonioni&#8217;s lauded proto-giallo <em>Blow-Up</em>) and Daria Nicolodi, Argento&#8217;s muse and future mother to the couple&#8217;s daughter, Asia.</p>
	  <p>Tuesday, November 25 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 85min<a name="Autopsy" id="Autopsy"></a><br />
      <strong>Autopsy</strong><br />
      <em>Armando Crispino, 1975</em> &bull; As the &#8216;70s wore on, <em>gialli</em> became increasingly outlandish and started taking their inspiration from unlikely sources. Armando Crispino&#8217;s 1975 outing Autopsy oddly but proudly echoes Tobe Hooper&#8217;s Texas Chain Saw Massacre in its opening credits, stock footage of exploding sun spots. Seemingly a result of these cosmic phenomena, a wave of suicides is overtaking Rome, which proves useful for medical student Simona, whose thesis is on the subject. However, when a beautiful young neighbor of hers is found dead, an apparent suicide, Simona decides that these deaths may not be suicides at all.</p>
	  <p>Tuesday, December 2 &bull; 7:00 PM &bull; 89min<a name="Pieces" id="Pieces"></a><br />
      <strong>Pieces</strong><br />
      <em>Juan Piquer Sim&oacute;n</em> &bull; A prime example of both the international influence held by the genre and its slow demise in the &#8216;80s, when it became confused with routine slashers, J.P. Sim&oacute;n&#8217;s American-set, Spanish-produced entry takes place on a Boston college campus, where a series of chainsaw murders have police stumped and the school&#8217;s administration&#8230; barely concerned. Pieces may be a notoriously bad pseudo-<em>giallo</em>, but it&#8217;s also a notoriously hilarious one. Produced by exploitation guru Dick Randall, Pieces is packed with lurid elements, from low-rent grue to the most gratuitous Bruce Lee impersonator ever to appear onscreen.</p>
