Winsor McCay hand-drew 25,000 frames for his <em>The Sinking of the Lusitania</em>. This week looks at some of these individuals, namely McCay, Blackton, Cohl, and Porter, and features <em>Frame by Frame</em>, a documentary by Paul Burnford providing a brief overview of several animation techniques in film.</p><p>April 4 6:00<br /><strong class="title">Germans</strong><br />140m</p><p>Hardly a decade after the works of McCay and Cohl, several German animators continued to discover new realms of animation. Fischinger was famous for his innovative commercials, working hard to conceal his secrets. Walter Ruttmann explored the abstract purity possible in animation, and Lotte Reiniger produced the first feature-length animated film, in a rare silhouette technique. Fernand Leger's classic <em>Ballet Mecanique</em>, which pushed the boundaries of film, is included, as is <em>L'Idee</em> by Berthold Bartosch, who actually worked with Reiniger before moving to films of his own.</p><p>April 11 7:00<br /><span class="special">Introduced by Don Crafton, Chair of Studies in Film, Television, and Theatre, University of Notre Dame</span><br /><strong class="title">Studio Era</strong><br />130m</p><p>Animation radically changed with the advent of studio-based production, becoming an entire industry with a direct and profitable appeal to a mass audience. Walt Disney, the Fleischer brothers, William Hanna, and Chuck Jones are just a few of the incomparable personalities of the era. Don't miss the all-time favorites <em>The Old Mill</em> and <em>Cat Concerto</em>, along with the first &quot;synchronized&quot;-sound animated film, <em>Steamboat Willy</em>, award-winning <em>Flowers and Trees</em>, and classic characters including Popeye, Road Runner, and Felix the Cat.</p><p>April 18 7:00<br /><strong class="title">What's Opera, Doc?</strong><br />Chuck Jones, 1957 7m<br /><strong class="title">Fantasia</strong><br />Walt Disney, 1940 120m</p><p>A true classic, <em>Fantasia</em> takes the fusion of music and animation in <em>Steamboat Willy</em> and Bugs Bunny's mock-operatic roles to a whole new level. The Philadelphia Orchestra is conducted by Leopold Stokowski, in a rare and fantastic collaboration. A visual and aural feast, <em>Fantasia</em> is a fantastic film for families and people of all ages and also the prime example of an animated film that both broke new ground and appealed to audiences everywhere.</p><p>April 25 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Lye and McLaren</strong><br />150m</p><p>Len Lye and Norman McLaren are two giants of direct animation, a technique which involves drawing directly on the film strip itself, rather than with traditional cells. While deeply invested with the notion of the material of film, both Lye and McLaren thoroughly explored the relation and capacity of their drawings to musical accompaniment. Lye is relatively obscure to many people, though powerful in a very personal way. For those of you from Canada, you very well may have grown up watching cartoons from the National Film Board, under which McLaren produced much of his work. Short works by Brakhage, Jordan, and Breer are also featured.</p><p>May 2 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Hubley</strong><br />100m</p><p>This week is a tribute to the revolutionary animation of the Hubleys. Their films were conceptually complicated and stylistically radical. While still appealing to a mass audience, they sought to distance themselves from the assembly-line standards of titans such as Disney. This week also looks at the unique work of Alexeieff and his &quot;pin animation,&quot; a technique which has rarely been employed, despite its provocative results and capabilities. He constructed his own pinboards, one containing over 1 million pins! Vera Neubauer and Robert Cannon, also featured, had a drive in many ways similar to the Hubleys, though still distinct and worth a reception of their own.</p><p>May 9 7:00<br /><span class="special">Introduced by Tom Gunning, Committee on Cinema and Media Studies</span><br /><strong class="title">Quay Brothers and Janie Geiser</strong><br />120m</p><p>The brothers Quay are strong devotees to the provocative surrealism of Jan Svankmajer (one of the night's screenings is their <em>Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer</em>). The Quays maintain a hands-on approach to their work, rather than merely conceptualizing and having others do the stop animation. Janie Geiser is renowned for her filmmaking, illustration, and puppetry. While she only started filming in 1990, her work is influential and known for its sense of mystery and self-contained worlds. These individuals have expanded the bounds of animation.</p><p>May 16 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Stop Animation?</strong><br />140m</p><p>These films explore the relation of animation to reality. Headlining tonight is Anders R&oslash;nnow-Klarlund's <em>Strings</em>, a feature-length tale of a king's son who sets out on a journey to avenge the death of his father. In Janice Findley's <em>A Nermish Gothic</em>, a young woman is chased around by a glowing cone until she retaliates with her giant hairnet. Intrigued? Also see her film <em>Beyond Kabuki</em> and Standish Lawder's <em>Runaway</em>, a reflection on animation, called &quot;a modern Ballet Mecanique&quot; by Herman Weinberg. George Griffin's <em>Trickfilm 3</em> is a combination of live action and animation that has a long history, all the way back to the Fleischer <em>Out of the Inkwell</em>, where Betty Boop was born.</p><p>May 23 7:00<br /><span class="special">Introduced by Malynne Sternstein, Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures</span><br /><strong class="title">Slavic Animation</strong><br />170m</p><p>Some of the most fascinating animation of all time is from Eastern Europe, by artists like Jan Svankmajer and Jiri Trnka. Svankmajer is featured in this screening, with his feature-length adaptation of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, complete with tack-jam and characteristically disturbing creatures. There is also one of his short films&mdash;<em>Tma svetlo tma (Darkness Light Darkness)</em>, fascinating in itself and as an allegory of the constraints of totalitarianism. Svankmajer is here accompanied by Trnka and Boroczyk, provocative and politically outspoken in their works.</p><p>May 30 7:00<br /><strong class="title">The New Animation</strong><br />130m</p><p>The ground-breaking <em>Toy Story</em>, from Pixar Studios, is featured tonight, accompanied by several short works: Bill Plympton's <em>25 Ways to Quit Smoking</em>, Nirvan Mullick's <em>The Box Man</em>, Paul Fierlinger's <em>A Room Nearby</em>, the Spiridellis Team's popular <em>This Land</em>, and Martha Colburn's <em>Evil of Dracula</em> and <em>There's a Pervert in our Pool!</em> This program is explores the new frontiers of animation, displaying its great potential. The advent of the Internet has changed production and exhibition, providing easy access to a whole host of short films from independent artists and larger companies, such as Britain's Aardman Animation (famous for <em>Wallace and Gromit</em> and more).</p>	<h3><a name="tuesday" id="tuesday"></a>Tuesdays - Friends &amp; Lovers</h3><p>March 29 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Bonnie and Clyde</strong><br />Arthur Penn, 1967 111m</p><p>Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) first sees Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) from her bedroom window as he tries to steal her family's car. Rather than reporting him to the authorities, she has the good sense to hit the road with him after a little necking in the back seat. They become robbers on a whim, although in the rural south of depression-era America, this isn't a very lucrative trade. Wanted signs multiply as their resources dwindle and their gang grows. Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman in his prime) and his high-strung wife cause trouble, but it is CW who does them in as it becomes apparent that their fame will overtake them. The period soundtrack is by banjo greats, Flatt and Scruggs. <em>16 mm </em></p><p>April 5 6:00<br /><strong class="title">Sid and Nancy</strong><br />Alex Cox, 1986 111m</p><p>Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman), bass player and ne'er-do-well of the notorious punk band, the Sex Pistols, is a drug-addicted squatter who doesn't know how to play bass. He and his band are the vanguard of a new scene that believes in nothing: no jobs, no style, no respect, no future. He meets an American drug-addicted squatter named Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb), and as the band blows up, Sid and Nancy drink, shoot heroin, fight and screw until the bitter end. This movie gives a lovingly squalid portrait of an underestimated subculture. <em>35mm</em></p><p>April 12 7:45<br /><strong class="title">Fanny och Alexander</strong><br />Ingmar Bergman, 1982 188m</p><p>In Sweden, at the beginning of the twentieth century, two children undergo many profound and difficult transformations. We follow watchful Alexander (Bertil Guve) and his little sister Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) through the lavish Christmas celebrations of their enormous theatrical family, then through the death of their father and their mother's remarriage to a comically, righteously evil Bishop, and their triumphant, supernatural escape. Bergman had said that this film was his most autobiographical (no word on whether Ismael was real, however). By turns hilarious, spooky and moving, this is one of the most watchable Bergman films.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>April 19 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Thelma and Louise</strong><br />Ridley Scott, 1991 129m</p><p>This is the definitive women's road-trip adventure film, replete with sexual awakening and massive explosions. Unhappy at work and pissed at her boyfriend, Louise (Susan Sarandon) dreams of taking off. Her friend Thelma (Geena Davis) suffers an even more dire unhappiness, stuck at home with a lug of a husband. A cat-and-mouse game with the FBI begins after Louise shoots a man who is sexually assaulting Thelma. Instead of turning themselves in, the women drive towards the Mexican border, ardently pursued by Hal (Harvey Keitel) and a growing cloud of police. As the women realize they can't go home again, their bond to each other becomes insoluble.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>April 26 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Manny and Lo</strong><br />Lisa Krueger, 1996 88m</p><p>Honored as a &quot;Sundance Fellow&quot;, director Krueger workshopped this film with the usual cast of Utah luminaries in 1994. In this, her first feature-length project, two sisters run away from their respective foster homes to hit the road together. Manny, born Amanda (Scarlett Johansson), is a serious-minded 11 year-old. Laurel, or Lo (Aleksa Palladino) is a 16 year-old whose dream of becoming a flight attendant may be thwarted by her ever-more-apparent pregnancy. At Manny's insistence, Lo grudgingly kidnaps Elaine (Mary Kay Place), the clerk at a baby-goods store. Elaine turns out to be trouble for Lo, but Manny finds in her a sympathetic maternal figure.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 3 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Jules et Jim</strong><br />Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, 1962 105m</p><p>Two best friends, a German (Jules, Oskar Werner) and a Frenchman (Jim, Henri Serre) go to Greece to find a statue of a beautiful woman, but on their way back, they find the real thing. Catherine (Jeanne Moreau) is the wedge between them and the tie that binds them, even as the First World War begins and the men are on opposite sides of the line. She is the original wacky girlfriend character, before it became an unavoidable clich&eacute;. This film, Truffaut's second best (after The 400 Blows), and a French New Wave classic, had an immeasurable impact on later filmmakers (the screenwriter of Bonnie and Clyde named his first daughter Catherine).  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 10 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Harold and Maude</strong><br />Hal Ashby, 1971 91m</p><p>Harold (Bud Cort, in the role that made him an icon but ruined his career) is a rich, death-obsessed, teenage misanthrope, whose out-to-lunch mother constantly sets him up on dates (that he ruthlessly sabotages). His outlook brightens when he meets the madcap Maude (Ruth Gordon), a vivacious, elderly, pot-smoking Holocaust survivor, who, like him, attends funerals recreationally. The two wreak havoc on the highway, take on the military, and find meaning together - until Maude's eightieth birthday. The sweetest love story to begin with a funeral and end with a car crash features a goofy soundtrack by Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens, formerly Steven Katz).   <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 17 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Benny &amp; Joon</strong><br />Jeremiah Chechik, 1993 98m</p><p>Benny (Aidan Quinn) has always taken care of his unbalanced little sister Juniper (Mary Stuart Masterson). His attempts to perform this task have ended in disaster, until, one night in a game of poker, Benny acquires Sam (the one and only Johnny Depp), his friend's vagrant cousin. Sam is a charming, illiterate Buster Keaton fanatic with unorthodox housekeeping methods, and Joon quickly warms to him. When they inevitably fall in love, Benny tries to stand in their way, but the couple overcomes this and other obstacles with touched (and touching) methods. The supporting cast includes indie favorites Oliver Platt, Julianne Moore, and William H. Macy. <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 24 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Fando y Lis</strong><br />Alejandro Jodorowsky, 1967 93m</p><p>This film's one-page long screenplay follows Jodorowsky's drug-laced memories of a play by Fernando Arrabal. In an improvised production, a lost couple searches for the mythical city of Tar, and moves through a torpid landscape beset by a cast of absurd characters. The film is hypnagogic allegory, a topology of perverse desires, masochistic gestures, seduction and betrayal. The premiere of <em>Fando y Lis</em> in 1968 incited a riot, forcing the director to escape in a limousine. The film was immediately banned. It has been considered lost for much of the past three decades.  <em>DVD</em></p><p>May 31 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Milo and Otis</strong><br />Masanori Hata, 1986 90m</p><p>A kitten and dog are barnyard friends who often cause light-hearted mischief. When Milo (kitten) decides to explore the inside of a box and is swept away down the river, Otis (pug dog) is quick to leap into the water as well. Their river mishap opens the doors to an outdoor adventure in which they are separated and search for each other through valleys, mountains, snow and bears. Originally in Japanese, the English version is narrated by Dudley Moore.   <em>35mm</em></p><h3><a name="wednesday" id="wednesday"></a>Wednesdays - Hindi Hearthrobs: Khan Men and Others</h3><p>March 30 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Lagaan</strong><br />Ashutosh Gowariker, 2001 224m</p><p>Mainstream America's favorite Bollywood movie (it even got an Oscar nomination!), <em>Lagaan</em> is in some ways atypical. It's set in the past, a sympathetic character is English, and there's no wedding. But it's still got the hallmarks of Hindi cinema: big songs and cricket. Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) makes a bargain with a wicked English official (Paul Blackthorne); if his villagers can win a cricket match against the English, they won't have to pay taxes. If they lose, the tax is harsher than ever. Do the underdog villagers have a shot? Well, they have Gauri (Gracy Singh) and Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) on their side. Fall in love with Aamir as he sings and dances on the roof. Khan count: One.              <em> 35mm</em></p><p>April 6 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Bollywood/Hollywood</strong><br />Deepa Mehta, 2002 105m</p><p>Acclaimed filmmaker Deepa Mehta (<em>Fire</em>, <em>Earth</em>) mocks every Bollywood clich&eacute; there is in this Indian/Canadian version of <em>Pretty Woman</em>. There is a long-suffering widowed mother, a grandmother who has advice for every occasion, and a surprisingly heroic transvestite. Even the dance numbers are tongue-in-cheek. As his sister's wedding approaches, Rahul Khanna is forced to hire a call girl to act as his future wife. Bonus points for recognizing all Bollywood movies referenced in this film (at least 12). Fall in love with Rahul Khanna as he interviews potential brides and Akshaye Khanna as he dances at the &quot;sing-song.&quot; Khanna count: 2. <em>35mm</em></p><p>April 13 7:00<br /><strong class="title">The Hero</strong><br />Anil Sharma, 2003 160m</p><p>Despite what you may think, Bollywood isn't only melodrama and romance. Well, okay, it is mostly melodrama and romance, but not completely. This action movie is a far cry from Bollywood's weepy soaps.  Master spy Arjun Khanna (Sunny Deol) survives avalanches, leaps mountaintops, and pretends to be a nuclear scientist in order to prevent Kashmiri insurgents from assembling a bomb in Canada (it's complicated). He also takes time to woo a shepherdess (Preity Zinta) and a doctor (Priyanka Chopra). Plus, there are musical numbers. Top that, James Bond! Fall in love with Sunny Deol as he saves the day again and again. Khan count: Zero.         <em>35mm</em></p><p>April 20 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</strong><br />Sooraj R. Barjatya, 1994 206m</p><p>Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and Prem (Salman Khan) meet when Nisha's older sister and Prem's older brother get engaged. It seems that fate enduces the two hours of flirting that follow. After this, the plot kicks into gear. This results in an hour of tears and family sacrifice that are not to be missed. A heart-warming favorite that ran for years in theaters (and is now out on special-edition DVD with karaoke), the film has all the Bollywood essentials. There are fourteen songs, Madhuri Dixit dances up a storm, and Salman Khan takes his shirt off. Salman, when he sings &quot;Pehla Pehla Pyaar&quot; in the kitchen, is not to be missed. Khan count: One.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 4 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Koi Mil Gaya</strong><br />Rakesh Roshan, 2003 171m</p><p>Rohit (Hrithik Roshan) isn't quite healthy. His physical weakness and childish behavior can doubtless be traced back to the car crash that his mother was in while pregnant. Why did the car crash? Because of the flying saucer summoned by Rohit's father, of course! Now Rohit's grown up and, with Nisha's (Preity Zinta) help, he summons the aliens just like his father did. What happens next in this crazy sci-fi Bollywood film? Think <em>E.T.</em> meets <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>, complete with songs and a basketball game. Hrithik's most endearing moment is when he informs Preity that soon he'll¡¦ripen. Khan count: Zero.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 11 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Mohabbatein</strong><br />Aditya Chopra, 2000 216m</p><p>Narayan Shankar (Amitabh Bachchan) has been in charge of Gurukul forever. As long as he's been in charge, there's been a strict rule against student romance. Of course, our three heroes (Uday Chopra, Jugal Hansraj, and Jimmy Shergill) fall in love anyway. With the help of the new music teacher (Shahrukh Khan), it looks like love might conquer all - until the dark secret of Gurukul's past is revealed¡¦ This film was designed as a launching pad for the six young stars, but it also contains an excellent performance by Bachchan (&quot;Actor of the Millenium&quot; according to a BBC online poll).  Fall in love with Shahrukh as he talks his way into the school. Khan count: One.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 18 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</strong><br />Karan Johar, 2001 210m</p><p>&quot;It's all about loving your parents.&quot; And, of course, adoption issues, love across class boundaries, and fitting three hot couples in one movie. Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) marries Anjali (Kajol) against his father's wishes and skedaddles to London. Two hours of film later, he's reunited with his family with the help of his brother Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) and sister Poo (Kareena Kapoor). But it really is all about the parents: played by real-life husband and wife Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, they steal every scene they're in. Shah Rukh shines during the scene with Kajol and the bangles, Hrithik during the cricket match, and Amitabh during &quot;Say Shava Shava.&quot; Khan count: One.   <em>35mm   </em></p><p>May 25 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Hum Tum</strong><br />Kunal Kohli, 2004 142m</p><p>It's just like <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>. Except that Sally is Rhea (Rani Mukherjee), and Harry is Karan (Saif Ali Khan), and there are musical numbers, and they didn't go to U of C. Okay, so it's not just like <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>. But it is a remake of it, and it is a lot of fun. Rhea and Karan fight during a layover in Amsterdam, start to like each other at Rhea's wedding, make friends in Paris, and then in Mumbai. Highlights include Rishi Kapoor as Karan's father, Absishek Bachchan as the most attractive computer engineer ever, and Karan's surprisingly effective use of pink pom-poms. Saif has a defense of the &quot;Tom Cruise look&quot; not to be missed. Khan count: One.       <em>35mm</em></p><p>June 1 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Kal Ho Naa Ho</strong><br />Nikhil Advani, 2003 186m</p><p>The Bollywood tearjerker to end all Bollywood tearjerkers (and it's set in New York!). Naina (Preity Zinta) and Rohit (Saif Ali Khan) are platonic friends when Aman (Shah Rukh Khan) shows up. Soon Naina falls for Aman, Rohit falls for Naina, and for a minute it looks like Aman falls for Rohit. It eventually gets straightened out, but not before hospital scenes, songs, and dramatic speeches. This film also includes Jaya Bhaduri (in a great performance as Naina's mother), a surprisingly practical six-day plan to get a girl, and the hands-down best-ever version of &quot;Pretty Woman.&quot; Saif charms yet again when he tries to walk cool. Khan count: Two.     <em>35mm</em></p><h3><a name="thursday" id="thursday"></a>Thursdays 1 - Mommy, Let's Go Home: Whack Children's Movies</h3><p>March 31 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</strong><br />Mel Stuart, 1971 100m</p><p>Young Charlie Bucket yearns to be like his fellow classmates.

He seeks the help of Eddie, a jaded private detective, to get to the bottom of the issue. Soon, though, the plot thickens as Marvin Acme is found dead and Roger Rabbit becomes the main suspect. Who is wreaking havoc on poor Roger's life and, more importantly, violently ending the lives of humans and toons alike?           <em>35mm</em></p><p>April 14 7:00<br /><strong class="title">The Witches</strong><br />Nicolas Roeg, 1990 91m</p><p>Adapted from Roald Dahl's book, <em>The Witches</em> follows the story of young boy, Luke who has recently been orphaned.

When he died, she decides to go to Yeshiva, a school to become a Jewish Raibi. The only problem with this is that only men are permitted to study there.

Perhaps better translated as Killer Number One, this film is about Ichi (who has a sweet pair of razor boots) and his gruesome campaign against all those in the world who he perceives as bullies. His foil, Kakihara likes daggers, self-mutilation, and is the quintessential bully (and is a yakuza lieutenant on top of that).

Along the way they evade a tenacious Europol agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and compete with a rival thief known as &quot;The Night Fox.&quot; This race against time is along a bumpy road with more than a few twists in it.

Zissou is joined by his estranged wife (Anjelica Huston), a beautiful pregnant journalist (Cate Blanchett), a pilot who may be his son (Wilson), and other quirky characters (including Willem Defoe). The crew must deal with pirates, a kidnapping, imminent bankruptcy, and other issues.

He falls in love at first sight, again, with a photographer, Anna (Julia Roberts). They later begin an affair, but by this point Anna is married to a dermatologist, Larry (Clive Owen). Larry and Alice have an affair, and then switch partners again, leaving everyone feeling horribly betrayed and insecure.

While trying to prevent the family fortune from falling into Olaf's hands, the kids travel through amazing worlds and meet many eccentric characters, including their neurotic Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep) and reptile-loving Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly). Based off the best-selling series of books, this movie is a dark fairy tale brought together by, well, a series of unfortunate events.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>April 15 7:00, 9:00, 11:00<br /><strong class="title">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</strong><br />Stephen Hillenburg, 2004 90m</p><p>Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

A struggling playwright on the London theatre scene, the married Barrie encounters an ill single mother and her four young boys, beginning a complex relationship with them that sometimes conflicts with his commitment to his wife. Staging elaborate play dates for the boys and their mother, his time with the family inspires the classic about the boy who will never grow up.

Ignacio hopes that Enrique will film his short story, &quot;The Visit,&quot; about the transexual diva Zahara (Bernal again) and his memory of sexual abuse at the hands of Father Manolo.

Deborah (T&eacute;a Leoni) constantly takes out her self-loathing neuroses on family, buying size-eight clothes for her size-ten daughter, and subjecting her husband, John (Adam Sandler), to similar ridicule. When John hires a Mexican maid, Flor, who only knows a smattering of English, the Clasky's strained relationships become embarrassing.

Such an occupation might seem to be poor preparation for heroism in a time of terror. But Paul's decency, quiet efficiency, and knowledge of how power operates help him to turn the hotel into a refuge for Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Even if the movie downplays both the brutality and the extent of the carnage, it presents the history of the Rwandan genocide with an urgency, moral outrage, and depth of characterization matched by few politically minded fiction films. <em>35mm</em></p><p>April 30 7:00, 9:00, 11:00<br /><strong class="title">Notre Musique</strong><br />Jean-Luc Godard, 2004 80m</p><p>Voted one of the ten best films of 2004 in the <em>Village Voice</em>, Godard's latest film is challenging, formally inventive, and quite rewarding. The masterfully edited first section, Hell, is comprised of found footage of warfare, including newsreels and clips from <em>Kiss Me Deadly</em> and <em>Alexander Nevsky</em>. Purgatory, the longest section, is a quasi-record of the European Literary Encounters conference held in Sarajevo, attended by an Israeli journalist (Sarah Adler), a Palestinean poet (Mahmoud Darwich), a Spanish writer (Juan Goytisolo), and Godard himself.

Could he have intentionally wounded himself to avoid certain death? With indefatigable spirit, despite the overwhelming odds and a leg made lame by polio from her days as an orphan, Mathilde tracks down and interviews the surviving men from Manech's company to find out what really happened to her lover.

The Fockers, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman, join as Greg's neo-hippie parents: a senior sex therapist and a stay-at-home dad who does capoeira. While they butt heads with Pam's parents, the ultra-conservative Byrnes family, regarding wedding plans and personal morals, Pam and Greg try to figure out how to hide her pregnancy. Everything culminates in a huge Focker-flocked party, where Greg is injected with truth serum and Focker jokes abound.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 13 6:00, 9:15<br /><strong class="title">The Aviator</strong><br />Martin Scorsese, 2004 170m</p><p>Howard Hughes (Leonard DiCaprio), heir to a large drill-bit fortune, led a storied, complex life. Director Scorsese focuses on aviation and women, Hughes's two great passions. The film follows Hughes from boyhood through his Hollywood glory days, directing the World War I epic <em>Hell's Angels</em>&mdash;starring Jean Harlow (played by Gwen Stefani!)&mdash;and romancing Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). Robert Richardson's cinematography replicates the colors of two-strip (and later, three-strip) Technicolor.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 14 6:30, 9:00, 11:30<br /><strong class="title">In Good Company</strong><br />Paul Weitz, 2004 109m</p><p>In his follow-up to <em>About A Boy</em>, writer-director Paul Weitz tells another charmingly bittersweet tale of modern love, this time set in the world of corporate America. When his company folds in a hostile takeover, head of advertising, Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid), is demoted to work under Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a recent business school grad half his age. Each at a crossroads in his life, the two men try to mesh their radically different approaches and see past their egos, but things get more complicated when Carter falls for Dan's daughter (Scarlett Johansson).

Anyone who saw the first <em>Animation Show</em> will want to come back for another hilarious and diverse group of shorts, which range from low-tech pencil drawings to computer animation. This installation includes Bill Plympton's Oscar-nominated &quot;Guard Dog&quot; and &quot;When Day Breaks,&quot; a beautifully animated tale that took four years to make. Although this movie is animated, it is definitely not for young children. <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 21 6:00, 9:00, 12:00<br /><strong class="title">Ray</strong><br />Taylor Hackford, 2004 152m</p><p>By combining gospel with rhythm and blues, Ray Charles virtually invented soul music. This movie places the emphasis exactly where it should be, on the music, portraying Charles's evolution as a remarkable musical artist. Important life events&mdash;his childhood, his blindness, his battles against racism and for artists's rights, his womanizing and drug addiction&mdash;are covered. The film doesn't sanitize its subject's messy personal life or his sometimes unattractive personality. Best of all is Jamie Foxx's electrifying performance in the title role; thrillingly, joyfully, he fully inhabits Ray Charles's soul, as a musician and as a man.      <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 27 7:00, 9:00, 11:00<br /><strong class="title">Inside Deep Throat</strong><br />Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato, 2005 92m</p><p>This documentary chronicles the breakthrough erotic film <em>Deep Throat</em>, investigating its making and its effects on culture. The original film grossed more than 600 million dollars and was banned in 23 states, yet it also legitimized porn. This documentary examines the abusive relationship between Linda Lovelace and Chuck Traynor, and it also provides glimpses at both the pro- and anti-pornography movements stirred up by <em>Deep Throat</em>. Documenting the moment that produced such a film and reviewing its impact on American society, <em>Inside Deep Throat</em> tells a tale that hopes to explain the juggernaut that to this day defines the controversial porn industry. <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 28 6:30, 9:00, 11:30<br /><strong class="title">Sideways</strong><br />Alexander Payne, 2004 123m</p><p>In a slightly modified version of the cruising-for-chicks-and-booze-road-trip film, Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti), a middle school English teacher and aspiring novelist, drives his friend Jack, a failed soap opera star, through California wine country the week before Jack's wedding. Along the way, they meet two beautiful women, who happen to be fellow wine afficianadoes. Relationships are strained as the week goes on, and the truth is revealed about Jack's fiancee and Miles' severe emotional issues. A true Payne venture, this film offers a hilarious series of explorations and failings of morality and maturity, much like his previous films, <em>About Schmidt</em> and <em>Election</em> .  <em>35mm</em></p><p>June 3 6:30, 9:00, 11:30<br /><strong class="title">Bride and Prejudice</strong><br />Gurinder Chadha, 2004 111m</p><p>Aishwarya Rai is one of the biggest stars on earth; who else could star in both Coke and Pepsi ads across multiple continents? Martin Henderson, he's that guy who was picked to play the entrepeneurial ¡®Amriki' Will Darcy opposite Rai's Lalita Bakshi in this adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. Set half in India and half in Beverly Hills (also watch for the houseboat on the Thames), the plot takes Austen's tensions and weaves them into a boy-meets-girl story of cultural stand-offs and reconciliations, with plenty of eye-popping visuals in between.

After stealing the show on opening night, she gets entangled in a murder case involving her childhood chum (Jean Gabin).

We follow Brook's Lulu on her many sexual conquests, including a pimp, a publisher, a showman, and a meter-reader.

By the end of the first reel, she's already been impregnated by her father's pharmaceutical assistant and sent to a reformatory. There she meets another fallen woman, Erika (Edith Meinhard).

After killing him in the opening scene, she disguises herself as a boy and runs off with a tramp named Jim (Richard Arlen). They find their way to a hobo camp, led by the notorious Oklahoma Red (Wallace Beery), who can decide their fate: The Law or the Canadian sunset. <em>Beggars of Life</em> is filled with many authentic details that contrast with Brooks's legendary beauty.  <em>16mm</em></p><p>May 8 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Toll of the Sea</strong><br />Chester M.

A sailor (Kenneth Harlan) promises to marry Lotus Flower, played by Anna May Wong, but instead leaves her with their child. Wong's performance is powerful, especially in the climatic scene where she is forced to betray her maternal instincts. <em>Toll of the Sea</em> is fascinating not only for its gauzy reds and greens, but also as one of the first films to place Asian actresses in supporting roles.  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 15 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Shanghai Express</strong><br />Josef von Sternberg, 1932 80m</p><p>Wong's most famous role comes alongside Marlene Dietrich in this adventure film.

Before long, the train is taken over by revolutionaries demanding sexual pleasure from Dietrich and Wong. This film features Oscar-winning cinematography from Lee Garmes (and an uncredited James Wong Howe) and dialogue like Dietrich's &quot;It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily.&quot;</p><p>May 22 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Piccadilly</strong><br />E.A. Dupont, 1929 116m</p><p>Piccadilly may be the definitive testament to Wong's radiance. Though the film was conceived as a vehicle for Gilda Gray, Wong received the most publicity, including a 15-foot topless poster in Austria. Wong plays Shosho, the scullery maid of Piccadilly, a once-fabulous London club now mired in conflict. After Gray's old partner leaves for America, Shosho becomes the new star, attracting the eye of the club's owner, much to the dismay of his lover (Gray). This common story becomes an atmospheric experience in the hands of German director E. A. Dupont (<em>Vari&eacute;te</em>).  <em>35mm</em></p><p>May 29 7:00<br /><strong class="title">Daughter of Shanghai</strong><br />Robert Florey, 1937 63m</p><p>The gem of Wong's Paramount period, <em>Daughter of Shanghai</em> features several Asian-American actors in major roles. When a wealthy merchant, Quan Lin (Ching Wah Lee) is murdered by a band of alien smugglers after refusing to help lighten their load, his daughter, Lan Ying Lin (Wong) teams up with FBI agent Kim Lee (Philip Ahn) to catch the smugglers. They wind up in Central America where Lin goes undercover and dances in a seedy dive. French &eacute;migr&eacute; Robert Florey also directed the classic <em>Murders in the Rue Morgue</em>.   <em>35mm</em></p><h3><a name="cidf" id="cidf"></a>April 1-5 - Chicago International Documentary Festival</h3><p>April 1 8:00 <br /><strong>Chicago Int.
