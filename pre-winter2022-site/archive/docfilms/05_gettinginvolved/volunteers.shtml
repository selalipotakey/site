 <h1>Getting Involved</h1>

<p>Doc is exclusively run by volunteers who manage every aspect from programming  to projecting. Get  involved with Doc by programming a film series  or by becoming a volunteer in one of the capacities outlined below. If you're interested, please contact us at <a href="mailto:docfilms@uchicago.edu">docfilms@uchicago.edu</a>.<br />
</p>
<h2>How to program a film series </h2><img src="images/volunteercollage2.jpg" width="150"  class="image" />
<p>Doc Films does not impose many restrictions on its programming. Anyone can propose a film series. Series may highlight the work of a particular director, star, screenwriter, cinematographer, or any other craftsmen worthy of a retrospective. Series may also be organized around genres, periods, national cinemas, political ideologies, or more abstract themes. </p>
<p>As a general rule,  films can only be shown <em>once</em> as part of a weekday series within a four year period. Click <a href="screenings1936-2008.xls" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of all the films shown at Doc since 1936 (.xls). Secondly, unless originally released in digital format, all films must be shown on 16mm/35mm. Every film series proposal must consist of ten titles in addition to two alternates should any of the other titles prove unavailable. Any film series proposal must include firm distribution as well as an accurate cost estimate for renting and shipping.</p>
<p><a href="http://imdb.com" target="_blank"> Internet Movie Database</a> or <a href="http://allmovie.com" target="_blank">All Movie Guide</a> should provide  pertinent information on  title, director, year, country and running time.  Read <a href="distribution.shtml">How to Find Distribution </a> to learn about where to find information on the distributor and the estimated rental and shipping costs. If you are interested in the programming at Doc, please subscribe to our <a href="https://mailman.cs.uchicago.edu/mailman/listinfo/docprog" target="_blank">programming mailing list</a>. Contact us at <a href="mailto: docfilms@uchicago.edu">docfilms@uchicago.edu</a><a href="mailto: docinfo@cs.uchicago.edu"></a> if you have any questions. </p>
<p>At our weekly <strong>programming meetings</strong> we discuss potential series for the next calendar. One need not be a Doc volunteer or affiliated with the university to take part in this dialogue, or to propose a series. Programming meetings take place <strong>every Wednesday at 5:30pm</strong> in the lobby of the Max Palevsky Cinema in Ida Noyes Hall.<br />
</p>
<h2>How to become a volunteer </h2>
<p>Anyone can volunteer at Doc Films, though priority will be given to University of Chicago students.

Volunteers  are asked to commit to working one screening per week for the duration of the quarter in one of the capacaties listed below. In exchange, each volunteer receives a pass that admits him or her and a guest to every Doc Films screening that quarter. We do not ask that volunteers spend much time at Doc, but it is very important that they respect whatever commitment they do make. </p>
  <p>If you are considering becoming a  volunteer, please attend our meeting for recruiting new volunteers in late September (exact date listed on the Doc calendar)<strong></strong> in the Max Palevsky Cinema. </p>
  <p>At our weekly <strong>volunteer meetings</strong>, board members report on and
    discuss their work managing Doc. All volunteers who want to
    get more involved or just want to learn more about how Doc 
    is run are welcome and encouraged to attend. Volunteer meetings take place <strong>every</strong> <strong>Monday at 6:00 pm</strong> in Ida Noyes Hall, Room 216.
    <br />
</p>

<h2>  Ticket Seller</h2>

<p>Ticket sellers are in charge of selling tickets before the movie. This is probably the easiest volunteer position and requires the smallest time commitment, about 45 minutes a week. Ticket sellers should be at Doc and ready to sell tickets at least thirty minutes before the beginning of the show, and are needed until 15 minutes after the show has begun.</p>
<h2> Fireguard </h2>
 
 <p>  Fireguards are in charge of directing the audience to an emergency exit in the event of a fire. Also, fireguards are in charge of taking tickets, cleaning the cinema after a movie, and preventing serious fire hazards, e.g. empty fire extinguishers and people sitting in the aisles. They help ensuring first rate show quality  by acting as the projectionist's &quot;eyes and ears&quot; in the auditorium and alerting the booth about eventual  problems. Fireguards need to work for about two and a half hours each week. They should arrive at least half an hour before their assigned show and are needed until about twenty minutes after the show has ended.</p>
  
  <h2>Apprentice Projectionist</h2>
    
    <p> Apprentice projectionists help the projectionists with their job while learning to do it themselves. We require that all of our projectionists have a least two quarters of experience as an apprentice with both 16mm and 35mm film so that we can be sure that they are competent before we turn them loose on an audience. </p>
    <h2>Projectionist</h2>
      
     <p> Projectionists are responsible for the projection of the movie. Projectionists must be highly competent in the use of 35mm and 16mm projectors. They must be able to deal with emergencies - broken equipment or damaged film - quickly and confidently. Projectionists must arrive at Doc at least an hour and a half before the start of their show so that they can be sure that the film and equipment are properly set up. They should expect to stay until at least 15 minutes after the end of the show. Projection is one of the most important jobs at Doc, and should not be taken lightly. For  projection manuals and other resources for projectionists, please see Doc Films' <a href="projecting.shtml">Projectionist Guide</a>. </p>
     <h2> Show Captain</h2>
       
       <p>Show captains are responsible for every aspect of the show. They should know how to do every job at Doc so that they can handle any situation that might arise. The show captain must arrive at Doc in time to let the projectionist in, and can't leave until the show is finished, the money is deposited, and the theater is locked down for the night. </p>
