<h2>Volunteers</h2>

<p>There are five main positions for volunteers at Doc Films. These positions are fireguard, ticket seller, projectionist, apprentice projectionist, and show captain. Each volunteer works one show a week<!--, with the exception of weekend show captains who work all three Saturday or Friday shows-->.</p>

<h3>Fireguards</h3>

<p>Fireguards are in charge of directing the audience to an emergency exit in the event of a fire. Also, fireguards are in charge of taking tickets, cleaning the cinema after a movie, and preventing serious fire hazards, e.g. empty fire extinguishers and people sitting in the isles. Fireguards need to work for about two and a half hours each week. They should arrive at least half an hour before their assigned show and are needed until about 20 minutes after the show has ended.</p>

<h3>Ticket sellers</h3>

<p>Ticket sellers are in charge of selling tickets before the movie. This is probably the easiest volunteer position and requires the smallest time commitment, about 45 minutes a week. Ticket sellers should be at Doc and ready to sell tickets at least thirty minutes before the beginning of the show, and are needed until 15 minutes after the show has begun.</p>

<h3>Projectionists</h3>

<p>Projectionists are responsible for the projection of the movie. Projectionists must be highly competent in the use of 35mm and 16mm projectors. They must be able to deal with emergencies -- broken equipment or damaged film -- quickly and confidently. Projectionists must arrive at Doc at least an hour before the start of their show so that they can be sure that the film and equipment are properly set up. They should expect to stay until at least 15 minutes after the end of the show. Projection is one of the most important jobs at Doc, and should not be taken lightly.</p>

<h3>Apprentice projectionists</h3>

<p>Apprentice projectionists help the projectionists with their job while learning to do it themselves. We require that all of our projectionists have a least two quarters of experience as an apprentice with both 16mm and 35mm film so that we can be sure that they are competent before we turn them loose on an audience.</p>

<h3>Show captains</h3>

<p>Show captains are responsible for every aspect of the show. They should know how to do every job at Doc so that they can handle any situation that might arise. The show captain must arrive at Doc in time to let the projectionist in, and can't leave until the show is finished, the money is deposited, and the theater is locked down for the night.</p>

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid #93C4F9">&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of our volunteers receive a pass which allows the volunteer and a guest to attend any or all of the movies we are showing that quarter for free. We do not ask that volunteers spend much time at Doc, but it is very important that they always show up when they have agreed to work. Since Doc is an entirely volunteer-run organization, we are interested in what all volunteers, from ticket sellers to show captains, have to say about how Doc is being run.</p>
