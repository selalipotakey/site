<strong class="title">Dr. Strangelove</strong><br />
Stanley Kubrick, 1964 93m</p>

<p>Two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kubrik's icy black comedy lampoons the insanity of nuclear deterrence theory. In the middle of the cold war, an eccentric general arbitrarily sends the nuke bombers to Moscow to destroy the USSR. While the president of the U.S. finds that the USSR is equipped with a &quot;Doomsday Device&quot; which will be automatically operated upon the nuclear attack, the bomber is approaching the target. Peter Sellers plays three roles: British group Captain, U.S. president, and former Nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 4 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">P&eacute;p&eacute; le Moko </strong><br />
Julien Duvivier, 1937 90m</p>

<p>Though long suppressed (it was removed from circulation so as not to compete with a Hollywood remake), this film inspired works as diverse as <em>Casablanca</em>, <em>Battle of Algiers</em>, and cartoons featuring the amorous skunk Pepe Le Pew. Jean Gabin stars as a gangster hiding out in the teeming, mazelike Casbah of Algiers. In spite of the danger, never once does he lose his cool - that is, until he meets Gaby, a femme who may or may not prove fatale. Gabin's iconic performance, the colonial setting, affecting use of music, and many memorable moments and scenes are among the reasons <em>P&eacute;p&eacute;</em> has deservedly been called one of the most enjoyable films ever made. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 5 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Sweet and Lowdown</strong><br />
Woody Allen, 1999 95m</p>

<p>Emmett Ray (Sean Penn) is the second best jazz guitarist in the world, and he is arrogant because of it. He is always drunk, angry, broke, or passed out, until he meets a girl (Samantha Morton). She cannot speak yet still manages to steal Ray's heart. This film, set in the depression era, is an example of Allen's most recent comeback to mainstream movie-making. Aside from this, it also gave Sean Penn his first taste of Oscar Buzz. This is the first film for which Allen used Zhao Fei (<em>The Emperor and the Assassin</em>) as his cinematographer. Uma Thurman makes an appearance as a detestable socialite. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 6 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Children of Heaven</strong><br />
Majid Majidi, 1997 87m</p>

<p>Nine-year-old Ali loses his younger sister Zahra's worn pink shoes on his way home from repairing them at the cobbler. For fear of punishment and because their father cannot afford to buy new shoes, the two devise a plan to keep their parents from discovering the truth: Zahra will wear Ali's over-sized tennis shoes to school, then run back each morning in time for Ali to get to school. But the plan has its flaws, and Ali tries other routes to get Zahra new shoes. This film is a simple and subtle critique of metropolitan class inequality. </p>

<p>January 6 9:00<br />
<strong class="title">White Zombie</strong><br />
Victor Halperin, 1932 69m</p>

<p>Neil and Madeleine go to Haiti to be married, having accepted the invitation of a chance acquaintance, Charles Beaumont, to come stay at his mansion. He is smitten with Madeleine, and appeals to a nearby plantation owner named Murder (Bela Lugosi), whose fields and mills are worked by zombie slaves, to turn her into a zombie. Murder complies, but Beaumont soon grows dissatisfied with his compliant yet unresponsive lover. Having fallen for Madeline, Murder develops his own plans for her. <em>16mm</em></p>

<p>January 7 6:30, 9:00, 11:30<br />
<strong class="title">Garden State</strong><br />
Zach Braff, 2004 109m</p>

<p>Andrew Largeman shuffles numbly through life, scraping by as a part-time actor and part-time waiter in a full-time lithium coma. His mother's sudden death forces him to journey &quot;home&quot; to Jersey. As Largeman (<em>Scrubs</em> star Zach Braff, in his screen-writing and directing debut) evades contact with his estranged father, he begins to wake from his medicated sleepwalk. He shifts through hometown acquaintances and stumbles upon a kindred spirit, Sam (Natalie Portman). With Sam's unexpected comfort and affection, Largeman pioneers the beauty and pain of an unmuted life. Sweetly offbeat, genuinely humorous, and, at times, quietly philosophic. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 8 6:45, 9:00, 11:15<br />
<strong class="title">Shaun of the Dead</strong><br />
Edgar Wright, 2004 99m</p>

<p>Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a thirty-something who has no talents or goals, a frustrated ex-girlfriend, an obsession with his mother, a job at an electronics store, a pint, and a comfortable couch. Though it may sound like the typical loser flick, this film offers something that others do not...ZOMBIES!! When the undead descend upon London, Shaun and his slacker friends arm themselves with cricket bats to defend their women, their world, and their local pub. Watch for the scene in which Shaun and friends debate which records are worth using as frisbees: No, put New Order down, throw Sade instead! Dry-witted Brits at their best. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 9 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">A Night at the Opera </strong><br />
Sam Wood, 1935 96m </p>

<p>One of the most hilarious Marx Brothers' films, <em>A Night at the Opera</em> tells the story of a young opera tenor who can't seem to make it and thus feels he can't marry his sweetheart. Groucho, Harpo and Chico take it upon themselves to make sure that the star of the opera is &quot;unable to perform&quot; and give their friend the chance he needs. The film features the famous cabin crowding scene, Harpo swinging tarzan style behind sets at the Opera house, as well as the usual honks, gags and humor at the expense of poor old Margaret Dumont that all Marx Brothers fans expect and love. </p>

<p>January 10 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Hibakusha at the End of the World</strong><br />
Hitomi Kamanaka, 2003 116m</p>

<p>In Japanese the word &quot;<em>hibakusha</em>&quot; usually refers to the survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but director Hitomi Kamanaka goes back to its literal meaning, &quot;victim of radiation. &quot; The film documents the lives of radiation victims around the world: Iraqi children irradiated by depleted uranium, American farmers living near the Hanford plutonium factory and survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The journey brings together a group of people separated by space and time to show how everyone living today may become a <em>hibakusha</em> with no prior warning. This will be the film's first theatrical release in the U.S. <em>VHS</em></p>

<p>January 11 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Le Jour se L&egrave;ve</strong><br />
Marcel Carn&eacute;, 1939 85m</p>

<p>A factory worker (Jean Gabin) has committed a murder and barricaded himself in his apartment. In a flashback, we discover what drove him to his crime. This film, with its powerfully sensuous atmosphere, striking expressionistic sets, and pervasive mood of romantic fatalism, has been hailed as a landmark in French poetic realism. It was later banned by the pro-Nazi, Vichy regime because of its proletarian sympathies and pessimistic outlook. The black and white cinematography is by Philippe Agostini; Maurice Jaubert composed the score. The film's director (Carn&eacute;), screenwriter (Pr&eacute;vert), and actress (Arletty) later went on to make <em>Les Enfants du Paradise</em>. <em>16mm</em></p>

<p>January 12 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">La Strada</strong><br />
Federico Fellini, 1954 115m</p>

<p>Anthony Quinn is a large, traveling strong man, trying to make a living as a vagrant. He takes on a clownish assistant Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) and brings her around Italy, trying to make lira without completely losing his pride, while maintaining distance from her innocence. The film also includes an appearance from Richard Baseheart as Il Matto, a clown whose sole desire is to provoke Quinn's Zampan&ograve; to the point of raging fury. Fellini guides the characters through many little vignettes showing the poorer side of post-war Italy as well as the beauty of its character. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 13 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Crimson Gold</strong><br />
Jafar Panahi, 2003 95m</p>

<p>Written by Abbas Kiarostami and based on an acual newspaper headline, this psychological thriller is a tale of class conflict in daily life. Hussein is an injured veteran, hulking yet reticent, who is now a pizza-delivery man. On his routes, he glimpses the opulence of the Westernized upper class. When he and his friend Ali are refused entry into a jewelry store for their working-class appearance, an unspoken rage slowly develops, culminating in an act that pushes him over the edge from sanity. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 13 9:00<br />
<strong class="title">I Walked with a Zombie</strong><br />
Jacques Tourneur, 1943 69m</p>

<p>This film reunites director Tourneur with producer Val Lewton, this time working with screenwriter Curt Siodmak, to create the high mark in classical Hollywood zombie films. In a story replete with echoes of <em>Jane Eyre</em>, a Canadian nurse travels to the West Indies to care for a rich man's strangely diseased wife. The nurse falls for her patient's distraught husband, and grows convinced that his wife has been turned into a zombie. But who would have done this, and is there a way to reverse the spell?</p>

<p>January 14 7:00, 9:00, 11:00<br />
<strong class="title">Hero </strong><br />
Zhang Yimou, 2002 96m</p>

<p>Fly above a mirror mountain lake and squint across the orange Gobi desert, as acclaimed Chinese director Zhang Yimou (<em>Raise the Red Lantern</em>, <em>House of Flying Daggers</em>) presents a perfect union of martial arts action, romance, and historical epic. Through the two thousand year-old story of the soon-to-be First Emperor of China, this film explores notions of heroism and loyalty, through the lens of modern-day Chinese nationalism. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle, famous for his work with Wong Kar-Wai, filmed <em>Hero</em> to be simultaneously violent and sensual, depicting both destruction and passion with lavish colors and vibrant imagery. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 15 6:45, 9:00, 11:15<br />
<strong class="title">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</strong><br />
Kerry Conran, 2004 106m</p>

<p>When scientists start disappearing as part of a nefarious plot to destroy the planet, only the derring-do of heroic Sky Captain (Jude Law) can save the day in this homage to the adventure movies of yesterday. Accompanied by Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), his investigative reporter ex-girlfriend, the two set out against flying robots to find the madman behind these doomsday machinations. Created almost entirely with the use of green screen, this highly stylized film is complete with Angelina Jolie as an eye-patch-wearing, no-nonsense air captain with lingering ties to our ace adventurer. <em>35mm</em></p>
  <h3><a name="week3"></a>Week 3: January 16-22</h3><p>January 16 2:00<br />
<strong class="title">Hero</strong></p>

<p>January 16 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">International House</strong><br />
A. Edward Sutherland, 1933 70m</p>

<p>A Chinese professor invents the television and invites people from all over the world to come and see it at the International House Hotel in Wu-Hu. Into the hotel comes Cab Calloway himself, Tommy Nash (Stuart Erwin) and Professor Quail (W.C. Fields). Tommy keeps developing a rash at the thought of marrying his fianc&eacute;, and causes the hotel to be quarantined. This absurdly hilarious film is chock full of classic vaudeville schtick. &quot;No, the doctor isn't in just now. Oh, he won't be back for a long, long time. He went out on one of those eternity cases. &quot; Need I say more? </p>

<p>January 17 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Lost Generation</strong><br />
Yuten Tachibana,1982 20m</p>

<p>This rare documentary is one of the &quot;10 Foot Movement&quot; films. These films are from a group of citizen activists organized by the Japan Peace Museum, to buy footage of the effects of the atomic bomb from the U.S. National Archives. </p>

<p><strong class="title">I Live in Fear</strong><br />
Akira Kurosawa, 1955 103m</p>

<p>In 1954 a Japanese fishing boat was showered with fallout from a U.S. hydrogen bomb test. Terrified by this event, Kurosawa made this film about an energetic factory founder who becomes obsessed by fear of nuclear radiation. The audience is led to sympathize with his reactions to the threat. </p>

<p>January 18 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">La Chienne</strong><br />
Jean Renoir, 1931 100m</p>

<p>Maurice Legrand (Michel Simon), a bank clerk, finds peace as a Sunday afternoon painter, much to his wife's chagrin. When he rescues Lulu, a beautiful femme fatale and prostitute, from a street altercation, he suddenly has both a new love and a place to hang his paintings. He embezzles funds from the bank to set Lulu up in an apartment, which he decorates with his canvassesthat she sells as he own for money. In this, Renoir's first sound film, Maurice's degradation is treated with humor, perceptiveness, and gentle irony: somewhat differently than one might expect in a film noir. <em>35mm</em></p>

<p>January 19 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Manhattan Murder Mystery</strong><br />
Woody Allen, 1993 104m</p>

<p>Hilarity naturally ensues as Allen and Marshall Brickman (<em>Annie Hall</em>) recreate the brilliant repartee of previous years. Also, this film marks the return of one of the great comic duos. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton lead a cast full of talent. Keaton believes that one of their neighbors has murdered his wife. Allen, naturally, is reluctant to meddle but soon Keaton enlists their friends (Angelica Huston, Alan Alda). This movie expresses Allen's love of New York and the amazing and unique abilities of New Yorkers to intellectualize everything, bordering almost on neurosis. </p>

<p>January 20 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">At Five in the Afternoon</strong><br />
S. Makhmalbaf, 2003 102m</p>

<p>One of the first films produced in war-torn Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, this hopeful, humanist work won Samira Makhmalbaf (daughter of Mohsen) her second Cannes Jury Prize. Noqreh is an ambitious young woman who yearns for education and strives to take advantage of her newfound liberties. Her dreams are under threat, however, from her traditionalist father and her family's extreme poverty and lack of security. </p>

<p>January 20 9:15<br />
<strong class="title">The Dead Are Alive</strong><br />
Armando Crispino, 1972 105m</p>

<p>Jason Porter (an excellent Alex Cord), a conflicted and alcoholic archaeologist, discovers an Etruscan tomb, undisturbed for thousands of years. Almost immediately fresh corpses start appearing in the graves, beaten to death. Porter finds himself the prime suspect, due to his volatile personality. Porter must find the real killer to clear his name: is it the oddly insecticidal security guard, the mysteriously scarred woman skulking around the camp, Porter's ex-wife's new husband, or something else?</p>

<p>January 21 7:00, 9:00, 11:00<br />
<strong class="title">Voices of Iraq</strong><br />
The people of Iraq, 2004 80m</p>

<p>Voices was filmed and directed by hundreds of Iraqis from April to September 2004. The producers, a gulf war veteran and two filmmakers (creators of MTV's &quot;Fear&quot;), distributed 150 digital video cameras across the country; they gave instructions on how to shoot and suggested questions for interviewing family and friends (What role should women have in society? What is Iraq's place in the Middle East?). The resulting 450 hours of footage were condensed down to an 80-minute collage. The approach provides a unique look into the daily lives of Iraqis, allowing them to tell their story. The soundtrack is by the Iraqi-Anglo hip-hop group Euphrates. <em> 35mm</em></p>

<p>January 22 6:45, 9:00, 11:15<br />
<strong class="title">I &hearts; Huckabees</strong><br />
David O. Russell 106m</p>

<p>A giant rubber ball of pain, a surly firefighter, and a life-size cutout of Shania Twain figure in this madcap &quot;existential comedy&quot; from director David O. Russell (<em>Three Kings</em>). When an eco-activist (Jason Schwartzman) sees his pet project get co-opted by a slimy corporate suit (Jude Law), he hires a pair of loony New Age detectives (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin) to justify his existence. They are, in turn, followed by a nihilist sexpot (Isabelle Huppert) who hopes to steer him to the dark side. Confusing, but also an absolute blast, this film's burgeoning content is leveled by moments of absolute hilarity. The nearly perfect score is composed by Jon Brion. <em>35mm</em></p>

<strong class="title">Hellzapoppin</strong><br />
H.C Potter, 1941 84m </p>

<p>Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson, along with their cousin Betty (Martha Raye) come to help their friend Jeff (Robert Paige) put on a show and thus make enough to marry the rich and beautiful Kitty Rand (Jane Frazee). The cast dance and sing their way through this bizarre, nearly postmodern film alongside clowns falling into swimming pools, bears on scooters, talking dogs, disappearing hamsters and of course, Busby Berkeley-esque dances with beautiful chorus girls. <em>Hellzapoppin</em> (adapted from the musical of the same name), has long been a cult classic.</p>

<strong class="title">War and Peace</strong><br />
Anand Patwardhan, 2001 148m</p>

<p>In 1998, India had five nuclear tests, followed a few weeks later by Pakistan's sixth. This escalation raised the tension between the two countries and fed the flames of nationalism. Indian director Patwardhan explores anti-nuclear movements and their connection to Ghandi's doctrine of non-violence in both India and Pakistan. Based on three years of interviews, the film, alternately titled Jang Aur Aman, covers Indian nuclear testing sites, uranium mines, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and even the Smithsonian. The film is part of an effort on the part of many South Asians, including Arundhati Roy, to counteract the rise of violent nationalism. <em>Beta SP</em></p>

<strong class="title">Le Corbeau</strong><br />
Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1943 93m</p>

<p>Hysteria erupts in a small French town after a series of poison-pen letters signed &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; (The Raven) reveal damning secrets about the village's citizens, including the protagonist Dr. Germain. The letters initiate a malicious cycle of rumors involving accusations of adultery, abortions, and illicit drug use. One of the few people to resist the panic is Denise, a young woman who later seduces the doctor. Made during the German occupation of France, <em>Le Corbeau</em> is famed for its dark and cynical ethos. Director Clouzot was banned from filmmaking for a time after the Liberation for espousing anti-French sentiments. <em>16mm</em></p>

<p>January 26 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Rear Window</strong><br />
Alfred Hitchcock, 1954 112m</p>

<p>Jimmy Stewart is a photojournalist stuck in a leg cast in the hottest days of the New York summer. He and his girlfriend (Grace Kelly) begin to suspect wrong-doing happening when they see a violent relationship unfolding in an apartment across the way. Suddenly the woman goes missing, and Hitchcock's suspense unfolds as suspicion of murder naturally grows. This is one of Hitchcock's great masterpieces, going beyond the initial suspense of the plot and delving further into the psyche of Stewart's character as he experiences the pressures of remaining in his loft apartment. </p>

<p>January 27 7:00<br />
<strong class="title">Taste of Cherry</strong><br />
Abbas Kiarostami, 1997 95m</p>

<p>A middle-aged, apparently well-off Mr. Badii cruises outside of Tehran, offering strangers money to do a simple job, which he is slow to explain. For an unstated reason, he is planning a suicide and seeks an assistant to provide minimal burial rites. The film centers around his conversations with his passengers - including a Kurdish soldier, an Afghani seminarian, and a Turkish taxidermist &ndash; as he persuades them to help him and tries to convince them that of the ethics of suicide exist. Winner of the 1997 Palme d'Or at Cannes. <em>35mm</em></p>

<strong class="title">Zombie</strong><br />
Lucio Fulci, 1978 91m</p>

<p>Ann is searching for her missing scientist father. She meets a reporter, Peter, who is investigating the source of a zombie found near New York aboard a boat connected to her father's work. They stumble upon an island infested with flesh-eating monsters. It seems a strange disease is sweeping through the island, turning normal people into zombies. Is Ann's father somehow responsible? Will they find a way to survive the ravenous zombie hordes at their backs? The masterpiece of Italian zombie films. </p>

<strong class="title">Zatoichi</strong><br />
Takeshi Kitano, 2003 116m</p>

<p>Blind old man, clandestine Japanese swordsman, massaging gambler, awkward tap dancer, kind house guest, wanderer&mdash;<em>Zatoichi</em> is a lot of things. More than ten years since the last of the older Zatoichi films and TV shows, this film finds the master of the lightning-fast draw mixing it up in a remote village dominated by samurai gangsters. Although director Kitano (who also plays the anti-hero Zatoichi) made the film as a homage to Kurosawa, expect something completely different from classics like Sanjuro and Rash&ocirc;mon. Instead, expect a bizarre&mdash;and very bloody&mdash;stylized delight of a showdown, complete with beautiful, vengeful geishas. <em>35mm</em></p>

Vincent Gallo, 2003 93m</p>

<p>Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo, who also directed the film) is a professional motorcycle racer, taking a road trip from New Hampshire to California. Along the way, he meets several women and visits the childhood home of his one true love, Daisy (Chlo&euml; Sevigny), for whom he still pines. In its initial cut, this was considered by some to be the worst film ever screened at the Cannes Film Festival, and spurred a now-famous verbal throw-down between Gallo and critic Roger Ebert. Thankfully, it's been recut. This version emphasizes the emotional complexity of Bud, and features a notorious motel room sex scene between Gallo and Sevigny. <em>35mm</em></p>

A Edward Sutherland, 1931 77m</p>

<p>Eddie Cantor (Eddie Simpson) is the assistant to a phoney fortune teller. Eddie gets mixed up in his bosses plot to steal from the owner of a doughnut factory (one full of lovely chorus girls who work off the pastries they eat in elaborate Busby Berkely numbers) when he mistakenly gets hired as the factory's financial advisor. Eddie falls for the owner's daughter while the factory workers' sport trainer (Charlotte Greenwood) falls for him. Constantly on the run from Greenwood and his former boss, Eddie must sing and dance his way out of this mess in order to prove his innocence. <em>16mm</em></p>

Susumu Hani, 1982 43m</p>

<p>This is another film to come out of the &quot;10 Foot Movement,&quot; edited by well-known director/activist Susumu Hani. The film portrays the sorrow of atomic bomb survivors in the cold war period. </p>

<p><strong class="title">When the Wind Blows</strong><br />
Jimmy T. Murakami, 1986 80m</p>

<p>This animated feature is based on the Raymond Briggs's book of the same name. It portrays Jim and Hilda, an elderly couple living in the English country-side. One day a federal radio broadcast announces the outbreak of war with the Soviet Union, and the couple, putting full faith in government knowledge, prepares for a nuclear attack.</p>

<strong class="title">Quai des Orf&egrave;vres</strong><br />
Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1947 102m</p>

<p>When a sleazy movie producer is found dead, the denizens of a seedy music hall come under suspicion, and Inspector Antoine (Louis Jouvet) arrives to sort things out. Long considered a masterpiece of French postwar cinema, this film was rarely seen in the U.S. until its 2002 rerelease. It is notable for its portrait of the sordid underside of Paris and also for its vivid rendering of the privations of the postwar period. The dialogue is witty, the characters are rich and complex, and the depiction of sexuality is refreshingly frank. The dazzling chiaroscuro cinematography is by Armand Thirard. <em>35mm</em></p>

Woody Allen, 1978 93m</p>

<p>Three daughters try to deal with the state of their lives and the state of their disintegrating family when their parents get divorced. The protagonist daughter (Mary Beth Hurt) is attempting to find some consolation from her sisters, but they are completely void of any sympathy or empathy regarding the family's destruction. Woody Allen's first serious foray into the land of pure drama, the family's hardship is filmed in natural color and portrays perfect familial conflict. The Bergman influences abound as Gordon Willis's (<em>The Godfather</em>) cinematography looks like it was taken out of Bergman's cameraman Sven Nyqvist's notebook. </p>

<strong class="title">10 on Ten</strong><br />
Abbas Kiarostami, 2004 87m</p>

<p>In this minimalist documentary, Kiarostami gives an intriguing lesson on his cinematic style and philosophy. Like his film <em>Ten</em>, he shoots within the confines of a single vehicle, this time with one digital camera posted on the dashboard.

<strong class="title">Casque d'or</strong><br />
Jacques Becker, 1952 95m</p>

<p>This tale of love and tragedy in the gritty underworld of Belle Epoque Paris is based on a real-life incident. Sultry, poetic, and beautifully made, at the time of its release the film was denounced as immoral by the French establishment, but was championed by younger critics. It went on to become a touchstone for the new wave. The story concerns a love triangle involving a gangster's moll (Simone Signoret) whose surface cynicism belies her inner tenderness. Signoret is vibrantly sensual and excitingly charismatic; this is the performance that made her a star. Becker went on to direct the noir classics <em>Le Trou</em> and <em>Touchez Pas au Grisbi</em>. <em>35mm</em></p>

Bob plots a heist of the Deauville casino, but his prospects for success seem so dubious one starts wondering if he shouldn't call it off. This stylish, witty, highly original work is both an homage to, and a comic revisioning of, the gangster film. Henri Deca&euml;'s cinematography captures some stunning views of Paris, especially its nightlife. Director Melville worked independently, often on shoestring budgets, to complete the film; and though it has long been acknowledged as his masterwork, it was not released in the U.S. until 1982. <em>35mm</em></p>

It was the dawn of the nuclear age: 3 weeks later Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima and then Fat Man on Nagasaki.

She marries her dress-maker, but Astaire still comes after her. Of course, love finds a way. As was often the case with this famous duo, the plot seems just a fun excuse to see amazing dancing and on-screen chemistry.

<p>One of the most famous monster films of all time, <em>Godzilla</em> was inspired by &quot;the Lucky Dragon Incident,&quot; the same accident that inspired Kurosawa's <em>Record of Living Being</em>. Recurring H-bomb tests awaken a Jurassic creature under the sea and mutate it into a radioactive monster, Godzilla. Although this film has long been a camp classic, the historical background provides a way to understand this film's attempt to portray something truly monstrous and terrifying that has been unleashed upon the modern world. <em>Godzilla</em> therefore can be seen as a clever critique of the nuclear age. While produced in 1954, Eiji Tsuburaya's special effects remain astonishingly real. <em>35mm</em></p>

Two young men, Arthur (Claude Brasseur) and Franz (Sami Frey), take up with the pretty na&iuml;f Odile (Anna Karina) they meet in English class. After several dates, dancing at a bar, and a race through the Louvre, Odile tells the guys that the aunt she lives with has large amounts of money hidden in her house. Through callow come-ons and intimidation, the pair draws Odile into a doomed robbery attempt. Godard elevates this deceptively slight film into a poignant portrait of a France on the verge of cultural change. <em>35mm</em></p>

Not surprisingly, the power company and their own television management dastardly pressure them not to report the incident. The evidence of danger and corruption gathered by the reporters supports the concern of a plant worker (Jack Lemmon), who also is planning to blow the whistle. The film explores moments when the capitalistic money-making urge undermines the safety of nuclear power plants. This film's power comes from its frightening reality: shortly after its release, Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island power plant accident occurred. </p>

The cool, deliberate, and masterful feel of this film demonstrates the evolution of Melville's style from his earlier 1950s heist films like <em>Bob le flambeur</em>. <em>Le Cercle Rouge</em> is perhaps the best example of Melville's unique and influential hybridization of Hollywood noir with Japanese samurai films, executed with a very French sense of style. <em>35mm</em></p>

Federico Fellini, 1963 138m</p>

<p>Marcello Mastroianni is Guido, the much heralded director who goes to a spa in search of a muse (Claudia Cardinale) and a plot for his new project. He has already spent much of the money on an outrageous concoction meant to be a launching pad for a spaceship. Guido also attempts to hide his mistress from his wife. Meanwhile, he is hounded by reporters, writers, fans, and many women. This is the film that you make when you can't think of a film to make, and Fellini turns it into an amazing portrayal of his own creative process. This classic film offers irreplacable surrealism that one cannot help but see. <em>35mm</em></p>

Michael &amp; Peter Spierig, 2003 104m</p>

<p>Meteorites bearing an extraterrestrial plague awaken the dead over Berkeley, a tiny town in Queensland, Australia. Soon, a small group of survivors is holed up in a remote farmhouse owned by Marion, a lunatic who claims to be an alien abductee. But who's to be trusted, and can they really afford to stay put as the zombies advance? What's really behind the zombie outbreak? It's a good thing Marion's such a gun-toting nutcase, since his triple-barreled shotgun sure comes in handy for dispatching the undead. </p>

<strong class="title">The Incredibles</strong><br />
Brad Bird, 2004 121m</p>

<p>Pixar's at it again! This time, the <em>Toy Story</em> and <em>Finding Nemo</em> creators have created a world where superheroes have been placed in witness protection programs and are forced to lead quiet suburban lives away from crimefighting. Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has become Bob Parr, who works for an insurance claims department, while his wife &ndash; the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) &ndash; works hard to keep her family's super-talents hidden from the public. When Bob is offered the chance to use his superpowers again, his family must reveal their true identities to save the world. This film, with its mix of animation, adventure, and comedy, is a must-see for all ages! <em>35mm</em></p>

<strong class="title">Tarnation</strong><br />
Jonathan Caouette, 2003 105m</p>

<p>Initially made for a total cost of $218, Jonathan Caouette's <em>Tarnation</em> has become a hit at film festivals worldwide. This autobiographical documentary combines 20 years of footage shot by Caouette himself (starting at age 11) with photographs, answering machine messages, and snippets of pop culture to create an indelible portrait of his mother Renee's battle with mental illness and its effect on his family. Equal parts coming-of-age story and experimental montage, the film is alternately harrowing and inspiring. As we watch Renee slip into dementia, we see Jonathan survive the trials of his youth to become a well-adjusted and talented young man. <em>35mm</em></p>
