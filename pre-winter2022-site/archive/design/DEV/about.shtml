<h2>About Doc Films</h2>
         <p>Doc Films is on record with the Museum of Modern Art as the longest continuously running student film society in the nation. In 1932, students formed the organization, which was then known as the Documentary Film Group, projecting 16mm documentaries from the back of a crowded classroom. Students have channeled their continuing love for the cinema into a world-class screening venue.</p>  <p><img src="images/oldsplash.jpg" width="395" height="232" alt="image from the Doc FIlms archive"></p>
		 
         <p>Providing an unquestioned resource to the University of Chicago and wider city community, Doc Films screens movies every night of the academic year, often showing movies that would not be shown elsewhere. Dedicated to providing a low-cost, high-quality venue for artistic, relevant and socially important domestic and international movies, Doc currently shows films at the Max Palevsky Cinema, 1212 East 59th Street. The theater is named after Max Palevsky, whose generous gift allowed Doc to build and operate a state-of-the-art cinema.</p>
		 
    <p>The cinema boasts two Eastman 25 16mm projectors and two Simplex 35mm projectors with Christie xenon lamphouses. The projectors' variable speed (usable for both 35mm and 16mm formats) and Doc's full silent image capability allow Doc Films to present silent films in the closest approximation to the original condition of their exhibition. The theater's Dolby Digital and Digital Theater Systems (dts) audio systems meet the highest standards in digital sound.</p>
	
    <p>Doc Films' outstanding equipment is matched by its rich and colorful programming. Students develop programming themes for each quarter of the academic calendar, dedicating one night a week to a particular theme. For example, during the Spring 2000 season, in conjunction with the Munich Filmmuseum, Doc Films showcased an exciting Wednesday-night series of films from the period around the German Expressionist movement. Other series have explored national cinema in Australia, Iran, Canada, and Mexico, topics such as international feminism, exile, the Surrealist movement and McCarthyism. Retrospectives of individual artists have included directors Martin Scorsese, John Sayles, Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger, Akira Kurosawa, Alfred Hitchcock, cinematographer James Wong Howe, and author Graham Greene.</p>

<p>Many familiar film directors have visted Doc to present films and lead forums. Alfred Hitchcock, Frederick Wiseman, Fritz Lang, Howard Hawks, Terrence Malick, Harold Ramis, and Woody Allen have led discussions and answered questions about their films.</p>

<p>Volunteering for Doc has led several former students to professional success in the creative arts. Former volunteers include Terry Curtis Fox, a playwright and movie critic for the <i>Village Voice</i>; David M. Kehr, former movie critic for the <i>Chicago Reader</i> and current critic at the <i>New York Times</i>; and independent filmmaker Aaron Lipstadt.</p>

<p>The Students who run Doc Films hope to reach a wide-ranging audience, from film aficianados to casual moviegoers, by cultivating and facilitating an excitement for the study of film. Their mission is to nurture and inspire future writers, filmmakers, and creative artists to tackle the professional world of cinema. </p>
