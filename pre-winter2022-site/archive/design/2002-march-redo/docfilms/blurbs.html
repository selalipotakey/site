1950</span>

<p>"Race Movies" are black-cast films made before 1950 for
segregated African-American audiences. They range in genre from melodramas,
thrillers, and musicals to comedies and Westerns. These independent productions
provided black viewers with images of African-American experience that were
conspicuously absent from Hollywood films, including black romance, urban
migration, social upheaval, racial violence, alcoholism, and color prejudice
within the black community. "Race Movies" by maverick African-American
directors such as Oscar Micheaux and Spencer Williams laid the groundwork for
later black filmmaking, from the commercial success of "blaxploitation" to the
stylistic references and social commentary of Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, and
Spike Lee.

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:00

<br>Oscar Micheaux, 1920<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>99m

<br>During the summer of 1919, there were race riots in more
than twenty U.S. cities. In Chicago, the local censor board initially censored
this film because its "8,000 Feet of Sensational Realism" included references
to interracial rape, concubinage, and lynching. Telling the story of an
educated black woman with a shocking past (Evelyn Preer), Within Our Gates is
Micheaux's second film and the earliest extant feature film by an
African-American director. This screening is sponsored by The Center for the
Study of Race, Politics and Culture. With live musical accompaniment.<span

<br>R. W. Phillips, 1918<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>13m

<br>Black representation in silent cinema consists primarily of
comic stereotypes, creating difficulties for black actors playing comic roles
like the legendary Bert Williams in A Natural Born Gambler. Spying the Spy was
produced by Chicago's Ebony Film Corporation, who sought to avoid dialect and
stock situations in favor of "quality" slapstick. With live organ accompaniment
by Jay Warren.

<br>Oscar Micheaux, 1924<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>104m

<br>Starring Paul Robeson as an ex-convict-turned-preacher and
his twin, a mild-mannered inventor, this film is artistically and politically
radical. Robeson and Micheaux used the form of double roles to expose and
explore dualities within the community when its coherence and religious
leadership were seen as crucial to its political advancement. Not a
conventional realist work, Body and Soul violates the Hollywood codes of
storytelling. Using flashbacks and dream sequences, Micheaux's editing seeks
simultaneity over continuity. With live jazz accompaniment by the Damian
Espinosa Trio.

<br>Roy Calnek, 1926<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>65m

<br>Based on a popular temperance play performed in black
communities, Ten Nights features two of the leading black stage actors of the
day: Lawrence Chenault as a bar room proprietor and Charles Gilpin as a
drunkard. The production company, the Colored Players Film Corporation, was
founded in 1926 by white producer David Starkman, who made popular melodramas
about black families and communities. Ten Nights enjoyed the longest continuous
run of any race film in the silent era: four weeks at New York City's Grant
Theatre. With live musical accompaniment by Funkadesi.<span style='mso-tab-count:

<br>Elite pianist Alvin (Harry Henderson) marries lower-class
Louise (Lucia Lynn Moses), but their social differences cannot be reconciled. A
melodrama of class conflict, this film is one of four produced by the Colored
Players Film Corporation for the "race movie" audience. Writer David Starkman
hired a white director and white technicians but worked with an all-black cast.
The film is notable for its high production values and its rare depiction of
color prejudice and class tensions within the black community. With live jazz
accompaniment by Fred Anderson. A reception will follow.

<br>Oscar Micheaux, 1932<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>44m

<br>Micheaux frequently recycled story material, and this film
is a remake of his 1925 silent The House Behind the Cedars, an adaptation of
the novel by noted black author Charles Chestnutt. Micheaux reinterprets
Chestnutt's story: here the light-skinned heroine, Rena, subverts the "tragic
mulatta" trap by enthusiastically choosing to claim her black identity and a
dark-skinned black entrepreneur boyfriend. This recently rediscovered print is
missing footage near the beginning, and the surviving footage is rough and can
be difficult to follow.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span><span

<br>Richard C. Kahn, 1939<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>56m

<br>Filmed on location at a black dude ranch near Victorville,
CA, this is one in a series of late 1930s race film Westerns featuring Herb
Jeffries as a singing cowboy hero. He rides to the rescue when the villain
(Clarence Brooks) tries to take control of a radium mine by kidnapping the
landowner's beautiful daughter. Jeffries rose to fame as lead singer with the
bands of Duke Ellington and Earl "Fatha" Hines. Also starring Spencer Williams.

<br>Spencer Williams, 1946<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>63m

<br>Spencer Williams wrote and directed nearly a dozen films
between 1939 and 1947 before concentrating on his role as Andrew "Hogg" Brown
in the 1950s television show Amos ‘n' Andy. In this urban melodrama, a small-town
girl named Daisy Mae Walker moves to New York City hoping to become a famous
singer. She befriends a number of interesting characters but also encounters
the harsh realities of city life and the cutthroat world of show business. Will
Daisy become disillusioned and abandon her dreams? Or will she continue her
quest for fame and fortune?

<br>Spencer Williams, 1947<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>70m

<br>One of the last films made by the great Spencer Williams,
Juke Joint is a fun-filled all-black-cast comedy about a pair of hitch-hiking
con artists named Bad News Johnson and July Jones. When the two arrive in a
small Midwestern town under the assumed names of Vanderbilt Whitney and
Cornbread Green, they become entangled in the lives of a local family, agreeing
to help train their two teenaged daughters for a beauty contest. This wild take
on black family life is highlighted by musical scenes featuring the talents of
Red Calhoun.

<br><span class="title">Hiroshima, Mon Amour</span>

<br>Alain Resnais, 1959<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>90m

<br>Marking a coming of age for European modernist cinema, Alain
Resnais's first feature is a complex portrait of a French film actress and a
Japanese architect who have a brief affair in post-war Hiroshima. Juxtaposing
the contemporary landscape with the woman's recollections of her affair with a
Nazi soldier, the film lies somewhere between memory and fantasy. With
voice-over dialogue by the lead characters, sudden breaks from the story action
to documentary footage of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and generous
use of flashbacks, Resnais plays the love story against our collective memory
of the city's nuclear destruction. A masterpiece of lyrical storytelling.

<br>Paul Verhoeven, 1990<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>113m

<br>Inspired by Philip K. Dick's short story "We Can Remember It
For You Wholesale," this action/sci-fi film tells the story of Douglas Quaid
Hauser, a construction worker who dreams of living on Mars, but whose wife
would never let him go. Enter Rekall, the memory implantation firm that
promises him an "ego trip" - a virtual memory holiday. He chooses to have the
memory of a secret agent programmed into his mind, but the implant seems to go
wrong; he remembers really being a Mars Intelligence Officer and finds that his
wife and friends are trying to kill him. Is his newly realized memory actually
"reality," and was his "normal" life merely an illusion? <span

<br>Chris Marker, 1962<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>28m

<br>This short film from renowned film essayist Chris Marker
tells the story on which 12 Monkeys was based. La Jetée is almost without
precedent, featuring complicated depictions of memory and a compelling take on
destiny. Made up almost completely of still photographs united by voice-over
narration and Marker's fantastic sense of rhythmic editing, this is a
science-fiction masterpiece.

<br><span class="title">Solaris</span>

<br>Andrei Tarkovsky, 1972<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>167m

<br>"Can a man truly reconcile with his irretrievable past, or
is he inexorably bound to the guilt and regret of his spiritual longing?"
Andrei Tarkovsky's adaptation of Stanislav Lem's seminal (meta)science-fiction
novel is a hypnotic, dream-like epic on love, faith, and reconciliation.
Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) is assigned to visit a mysterious
oceanic planet called Solaris, where two scientists inform him of the Ocean's
supernatural ability to materialize their thoughts. Kelvin is forced to
confront the now-tangible memories of his deceased wife. In long, meditative
images, the film's chronological disunity foregrounds issues of memory and
time.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

<br><span class="title">Eve's Bayou</span>

<br>Kasi Lemmons, 1997<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>109m

<br>Told in flashback, Eve's Bayou is about a well-to-do
10-year-old Creole girl (Jurnee Smollett) growing up in mid-1960s Louisiana who
tries to resolve the changing impressions she has of her parents and her
upbringing. Writer and director Kasi Lemmons weaves a complicated fabric of
memories, hallucinations, dreams, and the supernatural in this impressive
directorial debut, while the remarkable cast, led by Samuel L. Jackson and
young Smollett in her film acting debut, nearly steals the film. Narrated by a
grown-up woman recalling her past, the entire film is a hazily beautiful and
haunting childhood memory. An elegant work of magical realism.<span

<br>Ingmar Bergman, 1957<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>90m

<br>This is Ingmar Bergman's tour de force about the elderly
Professor Borg (film director Victor Sjostrom), who reminisces about his long
life's many regrets as he travels with his estranged daughter-in-law (played
with irresistible coldness and radiance by Ingrid Thulin) to receive an
honorary degree. The professor's memories unfold in a hallucinatory flashback
or dream-like style, as he frequently observes the sudden appearance of figures
from his past amidst his present settings. Wild Strawberries presents memory as
the key component in a voyage of discovery - a passage from estrangement to
enlightenment and a new, freed capacity to love and be loved.

<br>Adrian Lyne, 1990<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>115m

<br>Adrian Lyne's underrated gem tells the Pirandellic horror
story of Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins), a postal worker who begins to see
gruesome, nightmarish visions on the streets of New York City. Memories of his
lost son, his failed marriage, and an attack on his Vietnam combat troop haunt
him, and he is forced to confront his twisted, tortured psyche as he feels
increasingly threatened with death. As Jacob holds on tighter to what he thinks
is reality, his visions become more horrific and more intimately personal. The
grainy film stock and Maurice Jarre's sparse score perfectly complement the
claustrophobic, oppressive, hazy representation of New York.<span

<br><span class="title">Shoah</span>

<br>Claude Lanzmann, 1985<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>273m

<br>This documentary masterpiece is probably the most compelling
and haunting cinematic memory of the Holocaust. More than a simple record of
events, it is an oral history that removes the comfort of temporal distance
from the horrific events by placing them in the present. Claude Lanzmann
pointedly avoids depicting or reenacting scenes of destruction from the 1940s,
relying instead on recent interviews with Holocaust survivors, murderers, and
bystanders to create a testament to some of the most regretful acts of our
history. This is the first half; the remaining 290 minutes will be screened on
Saturday, March 2 at 12:00 noon.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

<br>Edward Dmytryk, 1965<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>108m

<br>Gregory Peck stars as David Stillwell, a New York accountant
who begins to think he is coming out of a two-year stint of amnesia. As he
tries to piece together the truth and his memory comes back to him, he finds
himself caught up in a conspiracy plot revolving around the death of an
executive who plunged from the building he was in the day that he lost his
memory. The film makes clever use of flashbacks, a staple of noir and other
crime thrillers, and it proves that the amnesiac conspiracy suspense film does
not begin with Christopher Nolan's Memento. Walter Matthau delivers a fine
performance as Ted Caselle, a sympathetic rookie private investigator.<span

<br><span class="title">The Killer's Kiss</span>

<br>Stanley Kubrick, 1955<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>67m

<br>Stanley Kubrick's first widely released film. A prize
fighter attempts to court a private dancer and protect her from her violent
gangster boyfriend. Kubrick wrote, directed, produced, edited, and photographed
The Killer's Kiss on the streets of New York on a shoestring budget, filming
mostly on location and often illegally. A gritty, stylistic film noir. 35mm

<br><span class="title">The Killing</span>

<br>Stanley Kubrick, 1956<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>85m

<br>The Killing is about a "foolproof" race track robbery that
entirely falls apart. It works almost like a jigsaw puzzle, filmed with raw
noir aesthetics and a documentary-like narrative style. This is the film that
put Kubrick on the map.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

<br>Stanley Kubrick, 1957<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>86m

<br>At the age of 29, Kubrick transitioned from his early work
to the epic scale of this film. Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) is a French infantry
colonel in World War I placed in charge of a suicide mission against a heavily
guarded enemy position in the trenches. After the majority of his unit
retreats, the commanding officer demands that three men be arbitrarily tried
and executed for cowardice. Dax attempts to save their lives, while raising
questions about the validity of the trial itself, the failed mission, and, on
some level, war in general. Kubrick's movies are often thought to be timeless
in a particular way, and this film may have been the first of those films.<span

<br>Stanley Kubrick, 1960<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>198m

<br>In some ways an antidote to the romanticism of biblical
epics like Ben-Hur, Spartacus is a sweeping, beautifully filmed studio epic set
during the Roman Empire. It replaces the light tones of Ben-Hur with somber
browns and reds, and instead of adrenaline-building action features horrifying
war scenes sometimes too difficult to watch. Notorious for its controversial
content and for the various power conflicts that ensued during production
(between Kubrick and the film's star and producer, Kirk Douglas, the studio,
and crew members), this film was at least partially responsible for Kubrick's
insistence on complete creative control over his later pictures.<span

<br>Stanley Kubrick, 1962<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>152m

<br>Kubrick was the first director gutsy enough to adapt
Vladimir Nabokov's novel about a sexual relationship between a middle-aged man
named Humbert Humbert (James Mason) and a 12-year-old girl. Backed by a major
studio in 1962, the result is certainly tamer than the original novel (and
Adrian Lyne's recent adaptation) but was quite controversial for its time. The
film has its share of sex, but the real energy and scandal derives from
innuendo and implication, which Kubrick exploits to full effect thanks to
Nabokov's adaptation of his own work - and, in particular, to performances by
Shelley Winters as Charlotte and Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty.<span

<br>Stanley Kubrick, 1964<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>93m

<br>Originally intended as serious, this film became adapted as
a satire and has since come to be one of the few films to successfully mock the
idea of a nuclear holocaust. An insane general (Sterling Hayden) sends U.S.
bombers to attack the Soviet Union, who informs the President that such an
attack will mean full-scale nuclear war. Only three men (all played by Peter
Sellers) may be able to stop the imminent tragedy: the U.S. president, a
British captain, and a former Nazi genius named Dr. Strangelove. Famous for
dozens of lines, scenes, and sight gags, including the Slim Pickens classic.

<br>Stanley Kubrick, 1971<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>137m

<br>Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is a young man whose "principle
interests are rape, ultraviolence, and Beethoven." The film seems to work
within these juxtapositions throughout, from the music to the slang Alex and
his droogs speak (a mixture of Shakespearean quips and London gutter slang).
When young Alex is caught and put in an experimental rehabilitation program, he
discovers a form of punishment far worse than prison. Depending on how you look
at it, a twisted sci-fi view of the near future, a sharp satire, or a
meditation on the present state of things, if not all three at once. Based on
the classic novel by Anthony Burgess, who later rejected the adaptation.<span

<br>After making numerous controversial films, Kubrick decided
to craft a meticulous, exquisite period piece. Of course, he did it in his own
particular way, insisting on no artificial light for night scenes, a wardrobe
of entirely antique costumes, and a production design constructed as if every
scene were an oil painting. The result is a deliberately slow and engaging
portrait of William Makepeace Thackeray's classic Irish rogue hero (played by
Ryan O'Neal), who travels the battlefields and parlors of 18th-century Europe
seducing, gambling, and dueling his way into nobility - and eventually letting
it get to his head. This was Kubrick's biggest Academy Award winner.

<br>In contrast to other Vietnam War films released in the
1980s, Kubrick's view of the war is intentionally awkward and structurally
disjointed to emphasize the feeling of war rather than the feeling of a
cinematic work. Unlike most other war films, which focus primarily on the war
itself, this film is split into two segments, the first of which is one of the
most traumatizing training sequences ever filmed. Kubrick cast a former army
drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey) as the trainer. Ultimately, the film is cold:
the narrator, Joker (Matthew Modine), speaks in a monotone about becoming a
trained killer, the music is sterile, and the photography feels grimy and ugly.<span

<br>Stanley Kubrick, 1999<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>159m

<br>Based on Arthur Schnitzler's Freudian 1926 novel, Kubrick's
final film was a massive undertaking that became one of his most debated works.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play a married doctor and art curator whose
relationship shows signs of tension. After she confesses to nearly having an
affair, his jealously drives him to have his own sexual adventure, leading to a
number of bizarre and harrowing encounters. Kubrick's meticulous attention to
detail shines. Rife with allusions, self-reference, and comedy, this is
certainly a film to be interpreted and misinterpreted for years to come.
Kubrick reportedly believed that Eyes Wide Shut was his best film.<span

<br>During the Spanish Civil War, Denard, a Republican

is not an agent but a musician, and Charles Boyer's performance as Denard adds
an appropriate sad tiredness reflective of the years of conflict he has

<br>J. L. Mankiewicz, 1958<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>120m

<br>British journalist Thomas Fowler (Michael Redgrave)
languishes in Vietnam, smoking opium, neglecting his duties, and living with
his girlfriend, Phuong. When American Alden Pyle (Audie Murphy) appears and
offers Phuong Western domesticity and political reform, an ideological battle
for her heart and mind ensues. Producer and director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who
wrote the screenplay from Greene's prophetic novel, downplays the communist reading
of the novel that prompted a stage version in Moscow.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<br>Alec Guinness, Noel Coward, Ralph Richardson, and Maureen

Wormold (Guinness), a Havana vacuum cleaner salesman with an overspending
daughter, is recruited as a paid operative for the Crown, he constructs a
fictional world of intrigue and operatives who somehow start turning up really
dead. Greene, who was close to the intelligence community, reportedly based
Wormold on a double agent operating in Lisbon during World War II.<span

<br><span class="title">Hamlet</span>

<br>Sven Gade, 1921<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>103m

<br>In this adaptation, Hamlet (Asta Nielsen) is a woman pretending
to be a prince in a scheme developed by her plotting mother. Hamlet's gender
provides her motivation for rejecting Ophelia's love, a relationship that is
further complicated as the focus of the film becomes their rivalry for
Horatio's love. Nielsen formed her own production company to make this film,
which is her own interpretation of the age-old legend of Hamlet. She continues
the tradition of manipulating texts to create new artistic pieces.

<br>On the opening night of Cole Porter's musical adaptation of
The Taming of the Shrew, the two leads, Lilli (Kathryn Grayson) and Fred
(Howard Keel), hold up the show with their bickering. Their off-stage lives as
a divorced couple become intertwined with their on-stage characters' lives. In
this self-conscious film, Porter deftly turns Shakespeare's story away from
ridiculing the whole female gender to ridiculing the Hollywood and Broadway
culture of stardom. In brilliant Technicolor.

<br>Akira Kurosawa, 1957<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>108m

<br>In a samurai setting, Akira Kurosawa's visual poetry evokes
the horror of Shakespeare's Macbeth in a style reminiscent of Japanese Noh

energetic embodiment of the ambitious Macbeth is complimented by his wife's

<br>Orson Welles, 1965<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>115m

<br>Henry IV and Henry V's robustly rowdy character, Falstaff
(Orson Welles), draws Welles and Shakespearean scholars alike to his tragicomic
life. The irreverent Falstaff serves as a foil to the dominating King Henry IV
(John Gielgud) as both vie to be Prince Hal's (Keith Baxter) father figure.
Welles draws Falstaff out of scenes in four of Shakespeare's plays to highlight
the character's unique philosophies on life. Shakespeare's fondness and
ridicule for Falstaff may reveal his identification with this witty fool.<span

<br>Akira Kurosawa, 1985<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>160m

<br>This adaptation of King Lear is considered one of the best
films ever made. Kurosawa seems to relate to the depression and despair of Lear
(Lord Ichimonji, played by Tatsuya Nakadai), rejected by his family and
deprived of control of his destiny. The most expensive Japanese film ever made,
Ran was in the works for ten years, and vast sums were used to create fantastic
battle scenes in brilliant colors. "Ran" means ‘chaos,' and Kurosawa blends the
chaos of battle intricately with the order of politics. <span style='mso-tab-count:

<br>For her adaptation of Shakespeare's revenge play, Titus
Andronicus, director Julie Taymor uses voluptuous costuming and theatrical set
design to create an atmosphere of excess. Titus (Anthony Hopkins) is a victorious
Roman general thrown into the world of the body politic and the schemes of
Tamora (Jessica Lange) and Aaron (Harry J. Lennix), who take revenge for
Titus's out-of-hand war crimes. But revenge proves too sweet for Tamora and
Aaron, as Titus prepares a most mouth-watering feast. <span style='mso-tab-count:

<br>Shakespeare's Hamlet contains so many logical problems that
T. S. Eliot proclaimed it a failure. Michael Almereyda resolves a number of
problems in this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>adaptation and, more
importantly, creates a Shakespearean film instead of the all-too-common
Shakespearean play on film. This urban Hamlet (Ethan Hawke) does not read; he
rents videos, and he makes a film to catch the conscience of his uncle. The
supporting cast is excellent and Bill Murray nearly steals the show with his
portrayal of Polonius.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

<br>Writer/director Richard Linklater (Slacker, Suburbia)
creates a highly innovative film using a unique combination of live-action and
animation to meditate on the distinctions and interplay of dreams, reality,
cinema, and perception. Shot initially on digital video, images were then
painted by a team of animators, using a distinct visual style for each episode
as we follow the protagonist through a series of dream, or dream-like,
encounters. Whether it's a monkey delivering a film lecture, Steven Soderberg's

Eviscerated of different reproductive organs, the remains of slain prostitutes

<br>Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a war bride waiting for her

the mansion's creepiness is the bizarre fact that Grace's two children are

<br>Catherine Breillat, 2001<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>86m

<br>Two teenage French sisters on vacation are plunged into a
summer of sexual discovery in this critically acclaimed exploration of
emotional complexity and confusion. Fifteen-year-old beauty Elena (Roxane
Mesquida) begins her sexual initiation with an Italian college student, Fernando
(Libero De Rienzo), while her overweight younger sister Anaïs (Anaïs Reboux)
observes from the sidelines. Characteristically, writer and director Catherine
Breillat (Romance) pulls no punches in her presentation of the loss of
innocence; in not romanticizing the topic, she leaves us with a shockingly
violent ending that is hard to watch and impossible to forget.<span

<br><span class="title">Spy Game</span>

<br>Tony Scott, 2001<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>127m

<br>On his last day of work at the CIA, ex-spy extraordinaire
Nathan Muir (Robert Redford)'s thoughts of sunny retirement in the Caribbean
are interrupted with news that his former protégé Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has
been detained in China on charges of espionage and will be executed within 24
hours. What's a loyal mentor to do? Despite the evolution of hairstyles and
fashion over the nearly 20 years spanned by the movie, the friendship between
the two men remains ever constant in times that are not. In the end, Spy Game
enthralls as a thrilling and suspenseful display of a mysterious career in
espionage - without all the rose-colored 007 hype.<span style='mso-tab-count:

<br>"I ain't done nothing funny," says Abby in Blood Simple. Au
contraire - as you might suspect, the Coens offer dark laughs and a clever plot
in this, their first feature film in a long line of noir-comedies (Raising
Arizona, Fargo, The Big Lebowski). Blood Simple tells the story of a seedy
Texas bartender (John Getz) who wants his cheating wife Abby (Frances
McDormand) and her lover murdered. Simple, really. But when he hires a private
investigator to carry out the bloody job, the plot thickens into a complicated
web of confusion, lies, and mischief. McDormand's film debut as Abby marks the
beginning of her numerous collaborations with the Coens. Re-released director's
cut!<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:

<br><span class="title">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone</span>

<br>Chris Columbus, 2001<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>152m

<br>Ah yes, Hollywood has seen fit to produce the inevitable
film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling's literary phenomenon. Young
Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives a lonely life in a cupboard under the
stairs of his mean-spirited relatives' house, only to discover on his 11th
birthday that he is a wizard - and a famous one at that. Featuring an adult cast
that reads like a who's who of British acting elite, Sorcerer's Stone is
remarkably faithful to the original book of the same name. From 4 Privet Drive
to the high-flying Quidditch match, the film's images delight, leaving Muggle
imaginations hungry for more.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

<br><span class="title">Shallow Hal</span>

<br>Bobby &amp; Peter Farrelly, 2001<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>113m

<br>This time around, the Farrelly brothers<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(There's Something About Mary) attempt
to bridge the gap between gross-out<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>comedy and warm-n-fuzzy romance. Keeping his promise to his late father,
Hal (Jack Black) has only ever dated women on the basis of their physical
appearance. Then the unexpected aid of a self-help guru sets Hal straight, and
he falls in love with 300-pound Rosemary, whom he sees as an incarnation of her
inner beauty (a svelte Gwyneth Paltrow). Shallow Hal marks the first leading
role for Tenacious D's hilarious Black (High Fidelity) and reveals a clear
evolution of the Farrelly movie formula from simple crassness to surprising
sweetness.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

<br>Richard Linklater, 2001<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>86m

<br>Vince (Ethan Hawke) and John (Robert Sean Leonard, Dead
Poet's Society) are thirty-something high school friends getting reacquainted.
Their conversation turns to the past and in particular to one high school night
when, according to Vince, John raped his girlfriend. Based on the play by
Stephen Belber and filmed in close quarters, this claustrophobic exploration of the vagaries of memory and truth builds steadily, then kicks into high gear when the girlfriend (Uma Thurman) shows up to provide her version of the night's events. Director Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused) creates an edgy, contemporary Rashomon that is not to be missed.<span style='mso-tab-count:
