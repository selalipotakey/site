          Doc Films is on record with the Museum of Modern Art as the longest 
          continuously running student film society in the nation. In 1932, students 
          formed the organization, which was then known as the Documentary Film 
          Group, projecting 16mm documentaries from the back of a crowded classroom. 
          Students have channeled their continuing love for the cinema into a 
          world-class screening venue. <p><img src="graphics/oldsplash.jpg" width="395" height="232" alt="image from the Doc FIlms archive">
        <p>Providing an unquestioned resource to the University of Chicago and 
          wider city community, Doc Films screens movies every night of the academic 
          year, often showing movies that would not be shown elsewhere. Dedicated 
          to providing a low-cost, high-quality venue for artistic, relevant and 
          socially important domestic and international movies, Doc currently 
          shows films at the Max Palevsky Cinema, 1212 East 59th Street. The theater 
          is named after Max Palevsky, whose generous gift allowed Doc to build 
          and operate a state-of-the-art cinema.</p>
        <p>The cinema boasts two Eastman Kodak 16mm and two Century 35mm projectors. 
          The projectors' variable speed capabilities allow Doc Films to present 
          silent films in their original format. The theater's full Dolby Digital 
          and Dolby Theater Sound (DTS) audio systems meet the highest standards 
          in digital sound.</p>
        <p>Doc Films' outstanding equipment is matched by its rich and colorful 
          programming. Students develop programming themes for each quarter of 
          the academic calendar, dedicating one night a week to a particular theme. 
          For example, during the Spring 2000 season, in conjunction with the 
          Munich Filmmuseum, Doc Films showcased an exciting Tuesday-night series 
          of silent, German Expressionist films from the early 20th century. Other 
          series have explored such topics as international feminism, exile, the 
          Surrealist movement and McCarthyism.</p>
        <p>Students also schedule retrospectives, featuring the works of such 
          distinguished filmmakers as Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock and cinematographer 
          James Wong Howe.</p>
        <p>A plethora of film professionals and legends have graced the Max Palevsky 
          stage to present films and lead forums. Hitchcock, Frederick Wiseman, 
          Fritz Lang, Howard Hawkes, Harold Ramis and Woody Allen have led colorful 
          and challenging discussions about their films.</p>
        <p>Volunteering for Doc has led several former students to professional 
          success in the creative arts. Former volunteers include Terry Curtis 
          Fox, a playwright and movie critic for the <i>Village Voice</i>; David 
          M. Kehr, former movie critic for the <i>Chicago Reader</i>; and independent 
          filmmaker Aaron Lipstadt.</p>
        <p>Doc Films also produces Focus, a quarterly publication that features 
          movie reviews, essays, and theoretical discussions on film&#151;written 
          by tomorrow's film critics. Students also run Doc's filmmaking wing, 
          Fire Escape Productions, which allows volunteer students to shoot and 
          edit projects utilizing 16mm, Hi-8 and SVHS formats.</p>
        <p>Doc Films collaboration with the University of Chicago's Cinema &amp; 
          Media Studies Department is an exciting program. Professors join with 
          students to program film series that allow film students to coordinate 
          their studies' with Doc FIlms' eclectic programming. A new venture for 
          students and the University is the establishment of production classes 
          to balance the cinema theory focus.</p>
        <p>The Students who run Doc Films hope to reach a wide-ranging audience, 
          from film aficianados to casual moviegoers, by cultivating and facilitating 
          an excitement for the study of film. Their mission is to nurture and 
          inspire future writers, filmmakers, and creative artists to tackle the 
          professional world of cinema.
