          There are five main positions for volunteers at Doc Films. These positions 
          are fireguard, ticket seller, projectionist, apprentice projectionist, 
          and show captain. Each volunteer works one show a week, with the exception 
          of weekend show captains who work all three Saturday or Friday shows.</p>
        <p><span class="series">Fireguards</span> are in charge of directing the audience to an emergency 
          exit in the event of a fire. Also, fireguards are in charge of taking 
          tickets, cleaning the cinema after a movie, and preventing serious fire 
          hazards, e.g. empty fire extinguishers and people sitting in the isles. 
          Fireguards need to work for about two and a half hours each week. They 
          should arrive at least half an hour before their assigned show and are 
          needed until about 20 minutes after the show has ended.</p>
        <p><span class="series">Ticket sellers</span> are in charge of selling tickets before the movie. 
          This is probably the easiest volunteer position and requires the smallest 
          time commitment, about 45 minutes a week. Ticket sellers should be at 
          Doc and ready to sell tickets at least thirty minutes before the beginning 
          of the show, and are needed until 15 minutes after the show has begun.</p>
        <p><span class="series">Projectionists</span> are responsible for the projection of the movie. 
          Projectionists must be highly competent in the use of 35mm and 16mm 
          projectors. They must be able to deal with emergencies -- broken equipment 
          or damaged film -- quickly and confidently. Projectionists must arrive 
          at Doc at least an hour before the start of their show so that they 
          can be sure that the film and equipment are properly set up. They should 
          expect to stay until at least 15 minutes after the end of the show. 
          Projection is one of the most important jobs at Doc, and should not 
          be taken lightly.</p>
        <p><span class="series">Apprentice projectionists</span> help the projectionists with their 
          job while learning to do it themselves. We require that all of our projectionists 
          have a least two quarters of experience as an apprentice with both 16mm 
          and 35mm film so that we can be sure that they are competent before 
          we turn them loose on an audience.</p>
        <p><span class="series">Show captains</span> are responsible for every aspect of the show. 
          They should know how to do every job at Doc so that they can handle 
          any situation that might arise. The show captain must arrive at Doc 
          in time to let the projectionist in, and can't leave until the show 
          is finished, the money is deposited, and the theater is locked down 
          for the night.</p>
        <hr noshade>
        <p>All of our volunteers receive a pass which allows the volunteer and 
          a guest to attend any or all of the movies we are showing that quarter 
          for free. We do not ask that volunteers spend much time at Doc, but 
          it is very important that they always show up when they have agreed 
          to work. Since Doc is an entirely volunteer-run organization, we are 
          interested in what all volunteers, from ticket sellers to show captains, 
          have to say about how Doc is being run.</p>
        <p> If you're interested in helping out, please contact us at 773-702-8574.
