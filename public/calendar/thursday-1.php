          <h1>THURSDAY 1 - The Three Amigos of Cinema</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by: Rocco Fantini</h3>

            <p>Alejandro González Iñárritu, Guillermo del Toro, and Alfonso Cuarón—together known as the three “amigos” of cinema—are masterful filmmakers and pioneers of the New Mexican Cinema movement. The three directors (and close friends in real life, so much so that one might find the three getting drunk together at a random Santa Monica bar) have diverse filmographies filled with works that are all enchanting in their own right—evident by the litany of awards received by Iñárritu, del Toro, and Cuarón. They have achieved international stardom for their directing, which albeit quite diverse in terms of style, tends to thread similar thematic needles about class, mortality, and the human condition.</p>

            <p>This series seeks to showcase some of the three directors’ best films while simultaneously highlighting cinema stemming primarily from Latin America (hence the selection of majority Spanish-language movies). Our hope is that viewers engaging with this series will feel inclined to delve deeper into Mexican cinema and, more broadly, Latin American cinema at large. Who knows? Perhaps we’ll see future Doc Films series centered on, say, Argentine or Brazilian cinema. Only time will tell.</p>

            <p>To put it bluntly: this series is filled with some damn good movies. We’re excited at the thought of watching <i>that</i> car chase unfold in <i>Children of Men</i>, massive robots fighting one another in <i>Pacific Rim</i> in 3D, and horny Mexican teenagers lusting over a Spanish MILF in <i>Y Tu Mamá También</i> on the big screen—all with a packed, vibrant theater. We hope that you are, too.</p>

          <h2>Birdman (2014)</h2>
          <h3>Alejandro González Iñárritu &middot; 119m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Washed-up actor Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton), almost synonymous with the iconic, twenty-years outdated superhero “Birdman,” mounts an ambitious Broadway production of Raymond Carver’s “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” in a quixotic attempt to revitalize his moribund career and ego. As opening night approaches, Thompson’s vainglorious effort to rebuild himself personally and professionally becomes an increasingly dark comedy of errors.</p>

          <h2>Children of Men (2006)</h2>
          <h3>Alfonso Cuarón &middot; 109m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>In a dystopian future where society is on the brink of collapse and mankind’s existence is threatened by infertility, <i>Children of Men</i> follows a disillusioned, former-activist bureaucrat (Clive Owen) in Britain—now a xenophobic police state—as he works to transport a miraculously pregnant woman to sanctuary. Aided by the work of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, Cuarón has created a timeless visual masterpiece filled with themes that still resonate today.</p>

          <h2>Pan's Labyrinth (2006)</h2>
          <h3>Guillermo del Toro &middot; 119m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>Pan’s Labyrinth</i> may very well be the film that truly put Guillermo del Toro on the map. While living In the countryside of Franco's Spain with her mother and dictatorial stepfather, 10-year-old Ofelia encounters an abandoned labyrinth, home to a mysterious faun who lays out a gauntlet of three trials Ofelia must complete to fulfill her only wish: to return to her real father. Destiny, fate, and mortality make strange bedfellows in this fantastical tale.</p>
          <p><i>Screening subsidized for members of the organization of Latin American Students (OLAS) in conjunction with its cultural show. However, all are welcome!</i></p>

          <h2>Biutiful (2010)</h2>
          <h3>Alejandro González Iñárritu &middot; 148m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>Biutiful</i> stars Javier Bardem (who won Best Actor at Cannes for his performance) as the Catalonian criminal and loving father Uxbal whose world progressively falls apart after a terminal cancer diagnosis. As his health worsens, Uxbal finds himself tasked with settling myriad things in his chaotic life before it’s too late. Bardem shines in this grim film that, fitting with this series’s theme (Three Amigos), names both Cuarón and del Toro as producers.</p>

          <h3>Alfonso Cuarón &middot; 135m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>Roma</i> follows Cleo, a housekeeper for a bourgeois 1970s Mexico City family on the brink of being torn apart—only for her own life to be upended by an unexpected pregnancy and militant boyfriend. <i>Roma</i> is a visually stunning, heart-wrenching, and unabashedly human film—a contemporary masterpiece. Receiving 10 Oscar nominations, the film is perhaps Alfonso Cuarón’s most intimate project, rhyming with his own upbringing in CDMX's Colonia Roma neighborhood.</p>

          <p>The film that won Iñárritu his first moment of international stardom, <i>Amores Perros</i> is a gritty portrait of life in Mexico City.

The film’s nonlinear narrative structure, powerful performance, and sense of realism make it a gripping, emotionally resonant drama fully deserving of its critical acclaim.</p>

          <p><i>The Shape of Water</i>, which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2018, is a quirky, fantastical romantic-fantasy that tells the story of an unexpected—and, yet, somehow natural—love between a mute janitor and an anthropomorphic aquatic creature/weapon held at a Cold War-era government facility. Guillermo del Toro’s poignant tale, which employs masterful set and costume designs, will capture your heart and imagination in a way you never thought possible.</p>
