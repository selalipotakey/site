          <h3>William Friedkin &middot; 122m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Based on a true story, <i>The Exorcist</i> ventures "somewhere between science and superstition" in the tale of an innocent young girl possessed by a foul-mouthed demon. Her mother desperately seeks help for her levitating, babbling daughter, but finds no answers in medicine--leaving Regan's salvation in the hands of two Catholic priests who must embark on an exorcism. Come for the thrilling religious horror, stay for the iconic torrents of green slime.</p>

          <p>From the Ugandan slum studio Wakaliwood of cult <i>Who Killed Captain Alex?</i> fame comes this gonzo action-comedy.

Exclusively at Special Collections in the Regenstein Library, opening January 2, 2024, through April 26.</i></p><p><i>Mothra</i> is a fantastical showcase of the Showa Era's flashy battes and goofy but impressive practical effects. It's also a critique of corporate Japan and the envrionmental toll of nuclear testing. Plus, <i>Ghidora</i> smashes in with an all-star Kaiju cast, as Rodan, Mothra, and Godzilla team up against the titular titan. With aliens, assassins, and political intrigue, <i>Ghidora</i> (and <i>Mothra!</i>) make for a one-of-a-kind experience to see on the big screen.</p>
