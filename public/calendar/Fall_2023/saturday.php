          <h3>Celine Song &middot; 106m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Celine Song wrote this screenplay for herself, but we're all glad she did. After settling in New York with her husband (John Magaro), Nora encounters her childhood sweetheart Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) and is faced with the lines of fate tying her not only to Hae Sung, but also to who she used to be. Based off of Song's experiences as a Korean immigrant, <i>Past Lives</i> presents a romantic drama that patiently explores inexpressible connections and the what-if’s.</p>

          <h3>Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson &middot; 140m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>This bildungsroman follows two spider-people from different universes, Miles Morales and Gwen Stacey, who refuse to be boxed into a simple hero's arc. The lauded visual and auditory experience created by 1,000 animators, Daniel Pemberton, and Metro Boomin reinforce the film’s narrative-breaking style and masterful execution of the multiverse. The story is so big, it can't fit into one movie. You'll simply have to come back to Doc to catch the next one.</p>

          <h3>James Mangold &middot; 154m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The fifth and final film in the ever-iconic Indiana Jones Series, <i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</i>  features an aging Harrison Ford, reprising his role of punching Nazis and exploring tombs to much fanfare. This time searching for the infamous Dial of Archimedes, <i>the Dial of Destiny</i> is as action-packed as ever. Come see machine learning CGI work its magic on Ford's iconic face. Oh, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge of <i>Fleabag</i> is in it.</p>

          <h3>Ira Sachs &middot; 92m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Director Tomas (Franz Rogowski) creates a maelstrom when he leaves his husband (Ben Whishaw) for a woman he meets at his film’s wrap party, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopolous). Of course, he is unable to completely end his marriage or his affair. Rogowski, clad in mesh and crop tops against a backdrop of artist abodes and Parisian parties, makes Tomas a fascinating, if not slightly repulsive, character. In other words, <i>Passages</i> fucks. Literally (rated NC-17).</p>

          <p><i>In the beginning, there was Barbie</i>. And then, there were <i>Barbillion</i>! It felt like a party — and we're bringing this party to Doc. Join us on your rollerblades, boats, rocket ships, and bicycles to celebrate a film about individualism, cognitive dissonance, and Kens discovering the patriarchy. Plus, Gerwig cites Demy, Tati, Kubrick, Gene Kelly musicals, and more as filmic influences. Come see what <i>that's</i> all about. The dress code is hot pink.</p>
