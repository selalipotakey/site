          <h1>TUESDAY - Asian American Media</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by: Carson Wang and Tien-Tien Jong</h3>

            <p>The films and videos in this series forged the first cohesive movement of Asian American media, yet their obscurity belies their historical significance, the movement's radical leftist ethos, and its calls for social justice and solidarity between all colonized peoples. Asian Americans were active in the Black Panther Party, formed part of Fred Hampton’s Rainbow Coalition, and joined with Black and Brown comrades in the 1968 Third World Liberation Front (TWLF). Asian American media was born out of this radicalism, with the first film collective, Visual Communications (VC), founded in the aftermath of the TWLF. This collectivized, anti-capitalist community cinema grew into the National Asian American Telecommunications Association (NAATA), which experimented with film form to provoke social change and maximize solidarity. This series surveys decades of VC and NAATA media and calls for a revival of their radical spirit.</p>

            <p>Most of the films follow what Loni Ding called an "anti-slick" approach, rejecting both Hollywood classicism and art film auteurist modernism for a humble, subjective style in-between fiction and non-fiction. At the same time, this series argues against nostalgically idealizing a dead movement. Several entries act as critical interventions, with sharp stylistic and ideological departures from the main body of films, exposing failures such as the exclusion of Muslim and queer voices, and a dependence on and deference to the settler-colonial state. Beyond problematizing Asian American media, the persistence of an oppositional stance within this series shows that radical Asian American media continues beyond its original institutional boundaries.</p>

          <p>Loni Ding, founder of what is now known as the Center for Asian American Media (CAAM), is a critical figure in Asian American media history. <i>Ancestors in the Americas</i>, her final film, is an epic of revisionist history that blends fiction and non-fiction. 35 years after its founding, CAAM shows its commitment to countermemory with <i>The Chinese Exclusion Act</i>, a portrait of the seldom-remembered Chinese Americans who redefined what it means to be American.</p>

          <p>These videos adopt poststructuralist doubts about objective truth, but end up with divergent results. <i>History and Memory</i> layers materials from both found and reconstructed sources to examine Japanese internment and its aftermath on a family. <i>Fresh Kill</i> is a bewilderingly fun "eco cyber noia": there's a South Asian lesbian who lives in garbage, a Chinese hacker and chef who serves radioactive sushi, and a Black "satellite dishwasher" raving about birds.</p>

          <p>"<i>Chan is Missing</i> announced that Asian Americans could be artists," remembers scholar Peter Feng. An audacious mix of noir and documentary, it follows a manhunt for Chan Hung, who becomes a stand-in for Chinese American identity itself, as no one can agree who he is, or was. Chan is never found: to be Asian American is not to inhabit a single preexisting identity, but to negotiate a new, unstable one, forging solidarities where they didn't exist before.</p>

          <p>An ambitious deconstruction of language, translation, and concepts of national and personal identity, this documentary features a collage of Vietnamese women’s voices, challenging the form and politics of traditional filmed ethnography. Weaving testimony with performance, and complex strategies of distanciation with self-conscious representation, <i>Surname</i> expresses “the impossibility of a single truth in witnessing, remembering, recording, forgetting.”</p>

          <p>We fight back! A pair of flashpoints for Asian American activism are portrayed in this double-feature: the first about the eviction of Filipino residents of the I-Hotel SRO, provoking one of history's most vigorous anti-gentrification organizing efforts; the second on the false imprisonment of Chol Soo Lee, which ignited a pan-Asian movement to free him. Both films see diverse communities drawn together in the shared experience of oppression.</p>

          <p>Tonight, the personal and the political collide in a revolt against the dominant narrative; countermemories from victims of trauma are presented which refuse victimization. <i>Sa-I-Gu</i> portrays the Korean-American women who fought against the brutality of the police after the LA Uprising; <i>Bontoc Eulogy</i> mixes fact, fiction, and performance as the filmmaker interrogates the archival record of his grandfather's exploitation as a human exhibit.</p>

          <p>Rebelling against the model minority myth, <i>Forbidden City, U.S.A.</i> shows generations of Asian Americans clubbing instead of studying, and features delicious archival discoveries like performances by the "Chinese Frank Sinatra." <i>I Remember Dancing</i> adds to the sense of liberation, with images of gaysians erotically recounting their unrepressed sex, emphasizing the value in opposing stereotypes without privileging just masculinity or heterosexuality.</p>

          <p>In 1968, the Third World Liberation Front demanded the decolonizing of academia, leading a group of Asian American artists to form the media collective and nonprofit Visual Communications. VC worked in a mode of anticapitalist community cinema, sharing collectivized authorship with their subjects. Tonight's films exemplify VC's unassuming yet passionate style, from the struggles of early immigrants to the polycultural fusion embraced by newer generations.</p>

          <p>From embassy waiting rooms to public-access TV, our series concludes with two interventions to the main program, to remind us of all the representations still lacking, and to avoid the construction of grand narratives in the act of programming itself. Abidi’s video is a window into Islamabad visa waiting rooms, while Moritsugu’s anarchic punk vision of a dysfunctional Japanese-American family sitcom is both merry mockery and vital, delightful outsider art.</p>
