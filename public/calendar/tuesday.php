          <h1>TUESDAY: After the 5th: China and the 21st Century</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by Addison Wood</h3>
          
          <p>This series was destined to fail from the beginning; a task as Herculean as surveying the cinema of China in the 21st century is, frankly, insurmountable. With “After the 5th,” I wanted to lean into this inevitability, to find a way of demonstrating the idiosyncrasies of contemporary Chinese filmmaking rather than reaching for a broad-stroke overview.</p>  
 
          <p>Each film in my series holds unique ground within the modern landscape of Chinese culture. Films like <i>Black Coal, Thin Ice</i>, <i>Still Life</i>, and vLong Day’s Journey Into Night_ represent the continuity of arthouse practices of the fifth generation filmmakers, whereas <i>Wolf Warrior 2</i> and <i>House of Flying Daggers</i> demonstrate the viability of mass-marketed commercial filmmaking. While the epic has largely been relegated to superhero franchises and a handful of ultra-popular Netflix-funded directors in the US, China has continued to produce massive works of propaganda and historical epics at an astounding rate. And yet 21st century Chinese film skews our understanding of more “Western” genres such as the indie coming-of-age dramedy (<i>Girls Always Happy</i>) and modern, social documentary (<i>Bitter Money</i>). But Chinese entertainment does not exist in a vacuum; with <i>Up the Yangtze</i> and especially <i>Dead Pigs</i>, we get a glimpse into the way North American and Chinese filmmaking cultures have only just begun to interact with one another.</p>

            <h2>Black Coal, Thin Ice (2014)</h2>
            <h3>Diao Yinan &middot; 110m &middot; Digital</h3>
            <p>Stomach-turning, erotic, isolating, and comic, all in equal measure. <i>Black Coal, Thin Ice</i> centers Zhang, a drunken former police officer, trapped in a game of cat-and-mouse after attempting to hunt down a serial killer who has dismembered and scattered bodies across Heilongjiang’s industrial landscape. What results is a masterful whodunit that melds neo-noir genre fare with biting social commentary. NOTE: Uncensored, international version.</p>

            <h2>Wolf Warrior 2 (2017)</h2>
            <h3>Wu Jing &middot; 123m &middot; DCP</h3>
            <p><i>Wolf Warrior 2</i> is the ultimate spectacle of Chinese propaganda filmmaking; yet it remains an enigma in the American cultural zeitgeist, despite standing as the highest-grossing non-English language film of all time for nearly four years, raking in the equivalent of $874 million. It’s the story of heroic Chinese military involvement in an unnamed African nation, but it's also a look at what the Chinese military apparatus sees as its future in geopolitics.</p>

            <h2>City of Life and Death (2009)</h2>
            <h3>Lu Chuan &middot; 133m &middot; 35mm</h3>
            <p>Both a maximalist war epic and a harrowing look at the effects of genocide and mass violence, <i>City of Life and Death</i> recounts the Nanking Massacre with a stark realism that refuses to pull any punches. Shot in crisp black and white, the film evokes the horrific images of war-torn China seared into the world’s collective consciousness. It is a beautiful tapestry and shocking testament to the unlimited cruelty men are capable of inflicting upon others.</p>

            <h2>Dead Pigs (2018)</h2>
            <h3>Cathy Yan &middot; 130min &middot; DCP</h3>
            <p>After last week’s screening, we need a little levity. Based on an actual incident involving 16,000 dead pigs, Cathy Yan’s (<i>Succession</i>, <i>Birds of Prey</i>) directorial debut is a kaleidoscopic tale of Shanghai in an era of breakneck development and increasing Western influence. Featuring a mix of Mandarin, English, and Shanghainese, <i>Dead Pigs</i> is a darkly hilarious social satire of humanity’s inability to find peace in an ever-changing world.</p>

            <h2>Girls Always Happy (2018)</h2>
            <h3>Yang Mingming &middot; 116min &middot; Digital</h3>
            <p>Yang Mingming's <i>Girls Always Happy</i> is a revelation in 21st century Chinese cinema. Blending comedy and drama in equal measure and featuring a toxic familial relationship that rivals the chaos of <i>Ladybird</i> and early Xavier Dolan, simultaneous writer/actor/director Yang Mingming's debut is a criminally underrated glimpse at a particularly fucked up Beijing duo of a mid-twenties daughter living with her mother in a cramped house.</p>

            <h2>House of Flying Daggers (2004)</h2>
            <h3>Zhang Yimou &middot; 119min &middot; 35mm</h3>
            <p>Zhang Yimou’s Oscar-nominated follow-up to 2002’s <i>Hero</i> is the spellbinding history of a doomed love-triangle set in the final years of the Tang Dynasty. Steeped in literary romantic tradition, while simultaneously paying homage to the legacy of wuxia filmmaking’s golden age, <i>House of Flying Daggers</i> is a staggeringly gorgeous work of martial arts crafted chaos that only the mind of Zhang Yimou, a true master of the medium, could create.</p>

            <h3>Jia Zhangke &middot; 111min &middot; 35mm</h3>
            <p>Jia Zhangke’s first film to take home Venice’s Golden Lion is the diptych narrative of two strangers in search of their respective partners set against the background of the destruction of Yangtze River communities brought on by the Three Gorges Dam. Featuring Jia's cousin Han Sanming playing a fictionalized version of himself working as a coal miner in Shanxi, <i>Still Life</i> toes the line between a documentary and a social-realist drama.</p>

            <h3>Bi Gan &middot; 138m &middot; 3D DCP</h3>
            <p>Despite the English-language title taking its name from the play by Eugene O’Neill, <i>Long Day’s Journey Into Night</i> is a work wholly its own. A dreamy vision of nocturnal Kaili, Bi Gan’s 2018 feature follows the wayward Luo in search of an elusive former lover. While narratively minimalist, the film’s rich style, which includes a mind-bending unbroken hour-long final shot, is some of the best visual storytelling contemporary Chinese film has to offer.</p>

            <h3>Wang Bing &middot; 163m &middot; DCP</h3>
            <p>Pivoting from the legacy of forced labor in Maoist China, Wang Bing’s gaze now shifts toward present-day Huzhou, to the hundreds of thousands of migrants working 12 hours a day in its textile industry. Unflinching in its portrayal of poverty and the inescapable routines of industrialization, <i>Bitter Money</i> refuses to play into pornographic depictions of suffering. Instead, it is an emphathetic lens into the modern conditions of working-class China.</p>

            <h2>Up the Yangtze (2007)</h2>
            <h3>Yung Chang &middot; 93m &middot; 35mm</h3>
            <p>A quietly angry depiction of rural China’s shift towards a tourism-based consumer economy, <i>Up the Yangtze</i> serves as a stark reminder of North American complicity in the struggle of everyday Chinese citizens. Centered around a riverboat cruise ship catered towards English-speaking tourists, Yung Chang’s 2007 feature debut maintains a melancholic optimism for the lives of two ordinary people coming to terms with their place in a new China.</p>
