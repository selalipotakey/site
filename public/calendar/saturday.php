          <h3>Olivia Wilde &middot; 123m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Olivia Wilde’s follow-up to her hit directorial debut <i>Booksmart</i> may be best known for its backstage disputes (did Harry Styles spit on Chris Pine?), but don’t you want to see the drama that led to all that drama? In it, a couple moves to an idyllic company town that harbors a horrific secret. Wilde framed her 1950s dystopia as pushback against modern-day incels, and critics praised her performance in the film, as well as Florence Pugh’s and Chris Pine’s.</p>

          <h3>Park Chan-wook &middot; 138m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Park Chan-wook won Best Director at Cannes for this haunting noir about a policeman (Park Hae-il) who falls for a murder suspect (Tang Wei). Park strips away the baroque style he became known for in films like <i>Oldboy</i> and <i>The Handmaiden</i>, stating he wanted to subvert modern tropes of the detective as either excessively violent or brilliant. The love story here was inspired by the Korean song “Mist,” which is woven throughout the film’s gorgeous score.</p>

          <h3>Gina Prince-Bythewood &middot; 135m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Inspired by—but in no way limited to—true historical events, Gina Prince-Bythewood's most recent release <i>The Woman King</i> stars Viola Davis as the titular leader of the Agojie, a group of warrior women who protected the African kingdom of Dahomey (modern-day Benin) in the 1800s. The film is an action-packed and energetic historical epic with some electrifying performances (what else would one expect from Viola Davis?), and a lot of heart.</p>
