          <h3>Paul Mazursky &middot; 105m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>It's ‘69, and the sexual mores of the mid-century have been smashed open. X-rated films were winning Best Picture, hippies camped out at a dairy farm upstate, gays were smashing windows, and a little dramedy about an orgy won over audiences across America. Featuring a killer score by Quincy Jones, multiple unshaved chests, and an Oscar-nominated screenplay, Paul Mazursky’s _Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice_ was the little husband and wife-swapping film that could. Bob and Carol, liberated by a New Age retreat, plan a hookup with their more traditional pals, Ted and Alice, in this work of lasciviousness and surprising emotional honesty.</p>

          <h3>Robert Altman &middot; 112m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>The Long Goodbye</i> starts not with a bang, but with a vibe. Elliott Gould’s Philip Marlowe wanders through a 1973 L.A. laden with denizens who have little between their ears. In typical Robert Altman style, he sends Marlowe into a rabbit-hole of dead friends and strangers. Suspicion falls on Marlowe after an old friend’s wife is found dead, but this quickly becomes the least of his worries. Gangsters, alcoholic writers, and detox clinics all join Altman’s cavalcade symphony of Malibu vapidity.</p>

          <h3>Michael Schultz &middot; 97m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Taking place on a single day of a happening Los Angeles car wash, Michael Schultz’s film is the perfect summer comedy encapsulating the zeitgeist of a rapidly changing American landscape. With an all-star lineup that includes Richard Pryor, Bill Duke, George Carlin, the Pointer Sisters, and Franklyn Ajaye, _Car Wash_ is a hilariously biting flick with an ineffable joie de vivre, and also a major milestone in ‘70s Black studio filmmaking.</p>

          <h3>Frank Pierson &middot; 139m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Not the first nor the last time this story would be told, but the only version written by Joan Didion. Need we say more? Sure, why not. The 1976  _A Star Is Born_ is the most recognizable adaptation of the classic story despite a generation accustomed to picturing Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in the starring roles. Barbara Streisand provides the tunes and Kris Kristofferson brings the raw '70s male sex appeal in the electric story of Esther and John: brought together by rock-and-roll, torn apart by alcohol and jealousy.</p>

He has succeeded.” “This is not a sequel– there has NEVER been anything like it!” “The world is full of them, the super-octane girls who are old at twenty… if they get to be twenty.” “This time… they’ve really gone <i>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</i>.”</p>

          <h3>Frank Perry &middot; 99m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Here at Doc, we've got Didion fever! Rarely screened publicly, <i>Play It as It Lays</i> captures the sun-drenched burnout of the classic 1970 novel of the same name. Maria, a restless actress brilliantly played by Tuesday Weld, finds herself in a loveless marriage and near constant mental turmoil as she travels back and forth between L.A. and Vegas. Expressing a distinct Didion brand of nihilism, Frank Perry’s _Play It as It Lays_ is perhaps the only big screen adaptation to do the late writer's work justice.</p>

          <p>Betrayed by the man he thought he knew best, Walker (Lee Marvin) returns to L.A. seeking revenge only to be caught up in an endless hunt for his ex-partner, Reese (John Vernon). Equal parts American genre film and European arthouse, <i>Point Blank</i> contains the nihilism of a man who has lost himself in the face of constant double-crossing and is plagued by the remnants of the Second World War. With stellar photography by Philip Lathrop, John Boorman’s major breakthrough is today an enshrined classic that helped to usher in the new age of hard-boiled American crime cinema.</p>

Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) navigate the rapidly declining studio film industry as foreign and indie films seem more promising than ever before. Cliff and Rick rub elbows with all the So-Cal bigwigs and freaks: Sharon Tate, Polanski, Bruce Lee, Mama Cass, and a guy named Charlie Manson who seems to be planning something big. Tarantino’s chillest film to date, <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> feels like a perfect summer day ... but remember, something creepy is always lurking in the night.</p>
