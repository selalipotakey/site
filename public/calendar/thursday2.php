          <h1>THURSDAY II: Myths, Legends, and Folk Tales: A Brief History of Animation</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by Solana Adedokun</h3>
          
          <p>
          Emerging in the late 19th and early 20th century, live-action and animated films share an intertwined history of development and growth that have transformed the world’s entertainment industry forever. Despite animation’s groundbreaking power, it is often underappreciated and relegated as a medium solely for children’s entertainment. This series exists not only to break that harsh stigma, but to cultivate the audience’s appreciation and interest in this challenging, unforgiving, yet utterly rewarding medium.</p>  
           
          <p>Each fantasy-adventure film that will be shown epitomizes the very best of animation in its respective time period, demonstrating not only the strength of animation as a serious storytelling method, but also as an artform unto itself. Whether it's the method of animation the filmmakers choose when bringing a story to life, or the way each technique lends a kind of character to the film that live-action cannot, audience members are sure to find something special in each movie.</p>

            <p>Directed by Richard Williams, <i>The Thief and the Cobbler</i> is infamous for its nearly thirty year production cycle that left it incomplete. While grossly over budget and meeting critical and commercial failure upon release, the film would later become revered by critics and fans.
