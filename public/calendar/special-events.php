          <h3>Lukas Dhont &middot; 105m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>His first film after his feature debut and Cannes Caméra d'Or-winning <i>Girl</i>, Lukas Dhont's <i>Close</i> stars Eden Dambrine and Gustav de Waele as two young teen boys, Léo and Rémi. Partially a retelling of Dhont's own childhood experiences, Léo and Rémi must navigate their relationship under new and unwanted scrutiny after returning to their normal lives following an idyllic summer together. Dhont took home the Grand Prix at Cannes for this film.</p>
          <p><i>Free pre-release screening! Followed by discussion and Q+A with director Lukas Dhont moderated by CMST Professor Aurore Spiers.</i></p>

          <p>A Greek family living in Istanbul is broken apart when they are deported from Turkey; the family's young son, Fanis, struggles to adapt to life in Greece and takes refuge in cooking, as it is his only connection to his grandfather and his homeland. The film's original title, <i>Politiki Kouzina</i>, can either be translated as "Cuisine of the City" (referring to Constantinople) or as "Political Cuisine," reflecting the dual themes underpinning this film.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, seven Chicago women were arrested and charged with building an underground network to provide illegal abortions—each facing up to 110 years in prison. These were 'the Janes,' an activist group which provided abortions to an estimated 11,000 women. This documentary, which includes interviews with the women of the collective, is an informative and vital viewing in a post-Roe America.</p>
