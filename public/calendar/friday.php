          <h1>FRIDAY - Philip Seymour Hoffman: A Retrospective</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by: Rocco Fantini</h3>

            <p><i>“I didn’t go out looking for negative characters: I went out looking for people who have a struggle and a fight to tackle. That’s what interests me.” – Philip Seymour Hoffman</i></p>

            <p>In the actor’s obituary, the <i>New York Times</i> described Philip Seymour Hoffman as “perhaps the most ambitious and widely admired American actor of his generation.” Hoffman’s versatility, brilliance, and scene-stealing presence makes his often-troubled characters a joy to watch. Although he lacked the stereotypical “look” of a Hollywood star, Hoffman—thrusted into acting after being inspired by a stage production of Arthur Miller’s <i>All My Sons</i> as a child—never failed to breathe humanity into every on-screen role he took on. Whether playing an empathetic male nurse in <i>Magnolia</i>, a distressed theater professor in <i>The Savages</i>, or a deranged cult leader in <i>The Master</i>, Hoffman always captivated audiences, elevating each film he starred in by virtue of his sheer talent.</p>

            <p>Through this retrospective, Doc Films will present an exciting selection of Hoffman’s filmography, offering a mix of fan-favorites (<i>Synecdoche, New York</i>), blockbusters (<i>Hunger Games</i>), and more subtle works (<i>Love Liza</i>). Whether or not one is a major fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman—although, frankly, who isn’t?—doesn’t change the fact that this series has something for all audiences. And, as we near the tenth anniversary of the actor’s untimely death, these screenings will allow Doc-goers to soak in some truly masterful performances.</p>

          <h3>Charlie Kaufman &middot; 123m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>Synecdoche, New York</i> follows Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an ailing theater director, as he leaves his bleak life in Schenectady, New York to create a mind-bending theater production that seeks to mirror all life in New York City—by literally recreating the city inside a massive warehouse. A film Roger Ebert called the best of the decade, <i>Synecdoche, New York</i> demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate its sheer complexity and surrealism.</p>

          <h3>Paul Thomas Anderson &middot; 183m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>PTA’s <i>Magnolia</i> is a varied tapestry of interwoven stories, each following a different resident of Los Angeles’s San Fernando Valley, and slowly coming together as the story unfolds. A marathon of unearthed secrets, family drama, and unrequited desire—with a final twist that feels almost like divine intervention—this is a film that shines through both the stellar performances of its ensemble cast and the tense relationships that Anderson constructs.</p>

          <p>While critically acclaimed, <i>The Savages</i> is still one of this series’ most criminally-underwatched films. In it, playwright Wendy Savage (Laura Linney) and her brother Jon (Philip Seymour Hoffman) care for their estranged, senile father, all the while reckoning with the dysfunctional nature of their familial and personal lives. It is a harrowing depiction of a dreaded but largely universal experience—that of watching a parent age and ultimately die.</p>

One fateful night, he stows away on a passing yacht being used by Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the charismatic leader of “The Cause”. Dodd is immediately enamored with Quell, setting off a tempestuous relationship between the two. Phoenix and Hoffman's searing performances in this film are career-defining and unforgettable.</p>

          <p>The first studio film to incorporate the 9/11 attacks into its narrative, Spike Lee’s <i>25th Hour</i> matches the funereal, somber tone in NYC at that time. The film follows former drug dealer Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) as he reevaluates his life in the 24 remaining hours before his 7-year prison sentence, spending time with his closest friends (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper) and preparing his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) for his lengthy absence.</p>

          <p>The last film Philip Seymour Hoffman completed before his death, <i>A Most Wanted Man</i> is an espionage thriller about a tortured Chechen migrant (Grigoriy Dobrygin) who settles in Hamburg and becomes a person of interest for a German agent’s (Philip Seymour Hoffman) rogue counterterrorism work. Based on John le Carre’s novel of the same name, this is a tense, cerebral tale of intrigue, rivalry, and politics—right through to its final hair-raising scene.</p>
