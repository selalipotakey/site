          <h3>Wes Anderson &middot; 105m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Dare we say <i>Asteroid City</i> might be the most Andersonian film yet. With a candied color palette and on-brand meticulous framing, Anderson's latest work is bound to satisfy aesthetically. It packs an emotional punch as well: the film follows the creation of a play and its characters who gather for a stargazing event. Using a compelling frame narrative, this self-reflexive work is a poignant dive into the creation and meaning of art.</p>
