              <h1>TUESDAY - Antropofagia: Reinventing Class and Race in Brazilian Cinema</h1>
              <h3>Programmed by: Gabriel Correa</h3>
              <p>Embracing the writings of Brazilian Modernism pioneer Oswald de Andrade, the Antropofagia ("Cannibalism") movement of the 1920s — sought to devour and assimilate external cultures and influences to forge a uniquely Brazilian expression in the arts within a post-colonial setting. With this series, I wanted to highlight classics and hidden gems of Brazilian cinema that put a certified Brazilian spin on beloved film genres while conveying the changing notions of class and race in the country over a span of more than 6 decades.</p>
              <p>From the raw portrayal of life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in the acclaimed <i>City of God</i> to the genre-bending Western <i>The Red Light Bandit</i>, each of these films holds up a mirror to Brazilian society with its rich, multifaceted, and sometimes contradictory history (especially as shown by the irreverent and satirical tale of the titular anti-hero in <i>Macunaíma</i>). Antropofagia cannot only look into the past though, and more recent films such as the imaginative <i>Bacurau</i> and <i>Executive Order</i> cast a critical eye on a near-future Brazil still grappling with its difficult history. Even if you are unfamiliar with the race and class politics presented in these films, you will still find universal themes and relatable characters you will want to root for. </p>

          <p>Welcome to <i>Bacurau</i>. Kleber Mendonça Filho’s award-winning third feature is a fiery Western described as “arthouse meets grindhouse”.

          <h3>Joaquim Pedro de Andrade &middot; 95m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>Possibly the most anthropophagic film in this series, this adaptation of Mário de Andrade’s 1928 modernist novel is an allegorical and satirical tale of Brazilian identity in all of its contradictions. Unmistakably political, <i>Macunaíma</i> centers around the titular self-centered, lazy, and promiscuous anti-hero (Grande Otelo / Paulo José) as he journeys from the jungle to the big city and back.</p>

          <h3>Rogério Sganzerla &middot; 92m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>The Red Light Bandit</i> is the ultimate gangster movie. Director Rogério Sganzerla’s “Third World Western” follows Jorge (Paulo Villaça) as the titular burglar, doomed to a life of crime and debauchery. This Godard-influenced irreverent gem of Cinema Marginal is an energetic and chaotic look at a morally corrupt São Paulo amid the turmoil of the ‘60s during Brazil’s brutal military dictatorship.</p>
