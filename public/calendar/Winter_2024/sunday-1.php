          <p>Sarah is a teenage girl with a penchant for fantasy novels and a misplaced disdain for her baby half-brother, Toby. Left to babysit, Sarah wishes out loud for him to be taken away by goblins. To her horror, her wish is granted, leaving Sarah to traverse an enormous Escher-esque labyrinth to confront none other than rock legend David Bowie, who looms large (in, uh, more ways than one) as Jareth the Goblin King.</p>

          <h3>Chantal Akerman &middot; 96m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Multiple love stories unfold against the backdrop of a modern shopping mall, centered around three women working in a hair salon. All of them are pursuing the same man–the son of a clothing store owner. In the legendary arthouse filmmaker Chantal Akerman’s take on a technicolor MGM musical, <i>Golden Eighties</i> both lampoons and celebrates the mall as a communal apparatus through the eyes of the lovelorn characters who occupy it.</p>

          <p><i>Screening sponsored by UChicago Folk Festival (Feb 9-10).</i></p><p>Loosely based on the <i>Odyssey</i> and set in rural 1930s Mississippi, the film follows escaped convicts Pete, Delmar, and Ulysses as they search for hidden treasure with a sheriff on their tail. This satirical Coen brothers film is shaped by a diegetic soundtrack of gospel, bluegrass, pre-war blues, and Southern folk music that was perhaps even more popular than the film, winning Album of the Year and selling over eight million copies.</p>

          <p><i>Co-sponsored by South Asian Students Association (SASA)</i></p><p>Starring Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury, <i>Mississippi Masala</i> has proven to be a complex and groundbreaking work, even three decades later. Mina is an Indian woman whose family was expelled from Uganda during Idi Amin's reign and finds herself growing up in Mississippi, where she eventually falls in love with Demetrius. Director Nair, with cinematography from Ed Lachman, creates a passionate and thorny romantic drama intertwining issues of both race and love.</p>

          <p>To have loved and lost or never to have loved at all? This commentator's inclined to say the latter... but <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> says differently! Celebrate Valentine's Day with Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), who break up and undergo a medical procedure to have each other removed from their memories. What follows is a hilarious yet poignant exploration of what it means to love (complete with a great song by Beck!).</p>

          <p><i>In collaboration with Society of Physics Students.</i></p><p>Now I am become Doc, the watcher of movies... Nolan's latest visual epic dives into the world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, from the enthralling inception of the Trinity Project to the morally tumultuous aftermath of his work. Cillian Murphy's tour-de-force performance accompanied by a stacked cast and grand score by Ludwig Göransson (along with some rather delightful moments with Albert Einstein!) make <i>Oppenheimer</i> a heartwrenching thriller.</p>
