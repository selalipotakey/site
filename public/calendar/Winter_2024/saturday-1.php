              <h1>SATURDAY 1 - Dinosaurs Plus! on Film</h1>
              <p>Dinosaurs ruled the planet for some 140 million years up until the end of the Cretaceous period, some 66 million years ago...</p>
              <p>Yet they have hardly been forgotten. Dinosaurs have long fascinated the public, a fact that did</p>
              <p>not escape the attention of Hollywood. Even now, when dinosaurs and other creatures inspired by them (such as those seen in the Godzilla movies) are cast in the lead roles, large</p>
              <p>audiences respond favorably to the films. Chicago, in particular, plays an important role in the history of</p>
              <p>dinosaur films. The first animated film and the first film about a dinosaur— <i>Gertie the Dinosaur</i>—</p>
              <p>premiered in Chicago at the Palace Theater on February 8, 1914. This series brings dinos and more back to Chicago. It includes</p>
              <p>some of the important life action and animated films featuring dinosaurs and the creatures inspired by them that wowed audiences over the course of</p>
              <p>110 plus years. [space] This series is a filmic supplement to the print material appearing in the</p>
              <p>Exhibition <i>Bibliosaurus!</i> that runs January 2 through April 26, 2024, 2024 in Special Collections at</p>

          <p>When thinking of Disney’s <i>Fantasia</i>, marching magic brooms and a sorcerer’s hat usually comes to mind. But what about dinosaurs? Set to Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring, <i>Fantasia</i>'s longest segment documents the beginnings of life from the Big Bang through the dinosaur age. Watch as dinosaurs spend their day-to-day eating food--and running away from <i>being</i> food--until sudden disaster strikes.</p>

O’Brien’s groundbreaking use of stop-motion effects laid the foundation for future monster movies and wonderfully depicts Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s tale of the eccentric Professor Challenger’s expedition to South America––where he believes dinosaurs still exist.</p>
