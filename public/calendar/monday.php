          <h1>MONDAY: Wonderfully Loathsome: Screwball Romance Through the Ages</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by Liam Flanigan</h3>

          <p>
          Does it get any better than a screwball comedy? One of Classic Hollywood’s foundational genres, these whip-smart movies are typically marked by mile-a-minute dialogue, class conflict, and—as this series will highlight—powerful romances. Although screwball partnerships are often distinguished by verbal sparring and clever comebacks, these films are all ultimately celebrations of love. Characters suffer through divorces, broken engagements, and endless bickering, but they also wind up with their destined partner. What’s wrong with believing in love?</p>  
              
          <p>But enough about romance; these are comedies, after all, and ones that are meant to be seen in a theater. There is a particular magic to laughing your head off with strangers in a dark room, and such an experience has been all too rare the last few years. Whatever your comedic preferences, from the unmitigated zaniness of <i>Bringing Up Baby</i> to the wry urbanity of <i>Ninotchka</i>, there is sure to be a film for you in this lineup.</p>
            
          <p>“Wonderfully Loathsome” is also, implicitly, a tribute to the luminous stars and extraordinary directors who have contributed their talents to the genre. Some featured artists are repeat masters of the form (Howard Hawks, Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn), while others have made their mark with only one or two screwballs to their credit (Barbra Streisand, the Coen Brothers, Greta Garbo). We hope you enjoy all of their work.</p>

            <h2>It Happened One Night (1934)</h2>
            <h3>Frank Capra &middot; 105m &middot; 35mm</h3>
            <p>Winner of five Oscars—Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Adapted Screenplay—<i>It Happened One Night</i> is a triumph of pre-Code comedy and a key antecedent to the screwball form. Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable are both magnetic as a runaway heiress and a struggling reporter who bond over the course of a trip from Florida to New York City. The palpable chemistry of Colbert and Gable—romantic, sexual, and comedic—makes this a must-see.</p>

            <h3>Howard Hawks &middot; 102min &middot; DCP</h3>
            <p>Directed by Howard Hawks with performances from Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, <i>Bringing Up Baby</i> unites three screwball icons for a wacky, romantic romp through the Northeast. Meek palaeontologist David Huxley encounters the charmingly chaotic Susan Vance and is pulled into a weekend of wild adventure featuring a disobedient dog, a precious dinosaur bone, and a pet leopard. A true romp in the best sense, <i>Baby</i> is an undeniable screwball classic.</p>

Directed by Ernst Lubitsch from a script co-written by Billy Wilder, <i>Ninotchka</i> is a warm-hearted love story with a sharp satirical edge.</p>

            <p>The Coen Brothers’ <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i> is one of the purest (and funniest) screwballs of the modern age. Elite divorce attorney Miles Massey (George Clooney) and serial divorcée Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones) match wits in this loopy, fast-paced tale of love and deception. With Roger Deakins' elegant cinematography and an endlessly hummable Carter Burwell score, <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i> stands out even amid the Coens’ remarkable filmography.</p>

            <p>After a string of unsuccessful films labeled her “box office poison,” Katherine Hepburn developed <i>The Philadelphia Story</i> as a comeback vehicle and was vindicated with a critical and commercial hit. Hepburn plays Tracy Lord, a Philadelphia socialite whose upcoming second marriage is drawing national attention. Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant co-star as a tabloid journalist and Tracy’s first husband, each of whose arrival complicates her wedding plans.</p>

            <p>Possibly <i>the</i> definitive screwball comedy, <i>His Girl Friday</i> stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as newspaper editor Walter Burns and his star reporter Hildy Johnson…who also happen to be ex-spouses. When Hildy decides to remarry and quit the paper, Walter convinces her to cover one last story, even as he tries to win her back. With pitch-perfect performances from everyone involved, this movie is more than a laugh-a-minute—it’s a laugh-a-line.</p>
