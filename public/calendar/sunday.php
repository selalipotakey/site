          <h1>SUNDAY - The Decisive Moment: Photographers Turned Filmmakers</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by: Ian Resnick</h3>

            <p>Eadweard Muybridge’s <i>The Horse in Motion</i> (1878), a series of 12 cabinet cards depicting the gallop of a horse, was the first documented example of chronography—a technique used to capture the passage of time through a series of rapidly alternating photographs. The cabinet cards could be viewed through a zoetrope to render the illusion of motion. <i>The Horse in Motion</i> is considered to be the first “motion picture,” showing that filmmaking is quite literally born out of the medium of still photography. One can step into the Doc Films projection booth and still see proof of this fact; peer down at a 35mm print stretched out on the light table, and you will see frame after individual frame, 1/24th of a second of your favorite films frozen in time.</p>

            <p>The histories of filmmaking and photography run parallel. Both struggled to acquire recognition as artistic mediums, relegated to labels of scientific tool or popular entertainment. This series seeks to shed light on the intersections of cinematic and photographic history—their shared figures, theories, and techniques. Here are presented works from filmmakers who began their careers as professional or amateur still photographers. The films presented span the 20th century, and reflect the photographic sensibilities of their directors: the pioneering modernist photography of Paul Strand and Willard Van Dyke, Robert Frank’s intimate documentations of American life, Gordon Parks’ civil rights photo-journalism, Spike Jonze’s BMX and skate videos. These works highlight the preoccupations of the wandering photographer, the concern with historical documentation, the visual spontaneity, the attunement to gesture, shape, and space. </p>

          <p>A pioneering work of social criticism, <i>The City</i> depicts the problems of modern urban life and the purported salvation of planned communities. Funded by the Carnegie Corporation, this documentary has been criticized for its propagandist inclinations. Yet its co-directors, modernist photographers Ralph Steiner and Willard Van Dyke, lend the work a remarkably poetic perspective.

          <p>Stanley Kubrick’s feature directorial debut, <i>Fear and Desire</i> was produced with a small crew of 15 people and an original shoestring budget of only $10,000, raised largely by Kubrick’s family. An anti-war film released under the context of the Korean War, Kubrick reportedly quit his job as a staff photographer for <i>Look</i> Magazine to make the film. Preceded by <i>Day of the Fight</i> a short documentary produced by Kubrick during his days with <i>Look</i> Magazine.</p>

          <p>A professional photographer before becoming a filmmaker, Varda cited a fluid relationship between her photography and filmmaking. Of <i>La Pointe Courte</i>, Varda recounted “I started making films with the sole experience of photography, that's to say, where to place the camera, at what distance, with which lens and what lights?” The film moseys through a port city in France, loosely following a couple contemplating their marriage, a fisherman, and a regatta.</p>
