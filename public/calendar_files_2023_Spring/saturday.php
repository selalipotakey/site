          <h3>Marie Kreutzer &middot; 114m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>On Christmas Eve of 1877, Empress Elisabeth "Sissi" of Austria turns 40, and is forced to relinquish her long-held status as a beautiful young woman. She must determine how to salvage her public image--and how to prove her worth in a society which now deems her worthless. What follows is an irreverent, modern, and subtly anachronistic spin on an iconic figure's story: a luxurious yet understated tale of melancholy, restriction, and rebellion.</p>

          <h3>Damien Chazelle &middot; 189m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Damien Chazelle's <i>Babylon</i> follows an ensemble cast of Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt, Diego Calva and more through the glitz, glamor, and corruption of late '20s Hollywood, in the transition from silent to sound movies. Divisive among critics upon its release, the film is both a condemnation of and a love letter to the world of movies and the Hollywood institution itself. You may love it, you may hate it, but regardless, you'll have a good time at the movies.</p>

          <h3>Todd Field &middot; 158m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Lydia Tár has it all—fast cars, a hot wife, and acclaim as the first female chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. She stands in front of her orchestra to give the downbeat to Mahler's Fifth, but a young cellist catches her eye. Shadows and sounds linger in her periphery... genius turned arrogance, past deeds, paranoia, and the rumblings of an orchestrated downfall. Can Tár face her orchestra and her ghosts? Can she obliterate herself for her music?</p>

          <h3>Steven Soderbergh &middot; 112m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>In the final installment of the <i>Magic Mike</i> trilogy, Mike Lane finds himself broke and retired in Florida. After meeting a wealthy socialite at a fundraising event, he takes her offer to go to London. Hoping for one last hurrah, he attempts to bring a group of new, talented dancers into shape. Starring the beautiful-as-always Channing Tatum, <i>Magic Mike’s Last Dance</i> is a tale of redemption set against a backdrop of post-pandemic economic uncertainty.</p>

          <img src="/images/2023spring/eo-2022.jpeg" alt="EO (2022) still">
          <h3>Jerzy Skolimowski &middot; 87m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>This one goes out to Ettore, Hola, Marietta, Mela, Rocco, and Tako. Winner of the 2022 Jury Prize at Cannes, <i>EO</i> centers its eponymous donkey, born and raised in a Polish circus, as he travels across the Polish and Italian countryside. Skolimowski's masterful homage to Bresson, released almost sixty years after <i>Au Hasard Balthazar</i>, provides just as frank an image of humanity from the perspective of an animal, in all its kindness and cruelty.</p>

          <h3>Laura Poitras &middot; 122m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The second documentary ever to win Venice's prestigious Golden Lion, <i>All the Beauty and the Bloodshed</i>  examines photographer-activist Nan Goldin's valiant effort to hold Purdue Pharma responsible for the opioid epidemic. The film paints a compassionate, gritty portrait of the fight against the Sackler family—Purdue's owners—through the lens of an indefatigable, battle-hardened woman. This is a sobering work that deserves to be seen by all.</p>

          <img src="/images/2023spring/godland-2022.jpeg" alt="Godland (2022) still">
          <h3>Hlynur Pálmason &middot; 143m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Like its Icelandic setting, <i>Godland</i> is beautiful, elemental, and more than 60% Lutheran. Writer-director Pálmason's third film follows Danish missionary Lucas as he journeys across the subarctic island with local guide Ragnar, lugging a hefty <i>fin de siècle</i>  camera across glacial meltwaters, volcanic mudflats, and others stunning landscapes of scarcity. Shot with natural light and in round-edged Academy ratio, <i>Godland</i> is simply sublime.</p>
