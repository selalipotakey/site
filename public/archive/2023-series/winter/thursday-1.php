          <h1>THURSDAY 1 - Splicing of the Atom: Nuclear Taboo in Cinema</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by: Max de Saint-Exupery</h3>

            <p>Ever since the dropping of the first atomic bombs publicly and devastatingly led to the end of World War 2, nuclear weapons have played an undeniable role in shaping our world’s geopolitics, energy industry and pop culture. The perpetual paranoia of sudden atomic annihilation has and continues to seep its way into global cinema and filmmaking, inspiring directors and audiences alike to question how the individual and society can respond to and coexist within an age of nuclear powers beyond our control.</p>

            <p>Each film in the series depicts nuclear weapons or energy across a variety of narrative perspectives, cultures and tones. Films such as <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i>, <i>Hiroshima</i> and <i>Godzilla</i> retell and reimagine the historical tragedies of the Kobe Fire Bombings, Little Boy and the Lucky Dragon 5 Incident from the nation that witnessed them firsthand, whereas <i>Fail Safe</i>, <i>La Jetée</i> and <i>When the Wind Blows</i> play into contemporary culture fears and speculation by transforming the atomic war into fabricated realities. In spite of their bleakness, these stories remind us of the (non-Mushroom shaped) light at the end of the tunnel by providing a glimpse into a spectrum of forms of reflection and coexistence, whether it be through retroactive satire (<i>The Atomic Café</i>) or through self-acceptance and maintain faith in a seemingly cold world (<i>Winter Light</i>). Across such a tonal range, audiences are certain to find something terrifying, awe-inspiring and comforting in each film.</p>

          <h2>Grave of the Fireflies (1988)</h2>
          <h3>Isao Takahata &middot; 89m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Directed by Studio Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata, <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> stands as the studio’s darkest film with its heartwrenching depiction of codependence, loss and near-helplessness in the midst of war. Following a pair of siblings, Seita and Setsuko, in their struggle to survive the final months of WWII after losing their parents in the Kobe bombings, the film ruthlessly showcases how global conflict has evolved to tear down even civilians.</p>

          <h3>Hideo Sekigawa &middot; 104m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Set during the immediate years after August 6th, 1945, <i>Hiroshima</i> portrays a classroom in their attempt to return to normalcy after the atom bomb destroyed their city, ravaged not just by radiation poisoning but also reckless gambling and discrimination against scarred victims. Featuring hundreds of Hiroshima survivors within its cast, the film portrays a dramatic yet accurate recreation of one of the 20th century’s most infamous tragedies.</p>

          <h3>Ingmar Bergman &middot; 81m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The second film of Ingmar Berman’s “spiritual” trilogy, <i>Winter Light</i> focuses on Tomas Ericsson, a pastor stricken with a personal crisis in faith, as he delivers a service for a small congregation including a fisherman debilitatingly frightened by nuclear war to Ericsson’s atheist ex-mistress. Profound in its depiction of existentialism and faith on an individual scale, the film harshly ponders God’s absence, silence, and love for His creations.</p>

          <h3>Jayne Loader, Kevin Rafferty, and Pierce Rafferty &middot; 86m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A sardonic reflection on the threat of nuclear destruction, this 1982 film splices together dozens of mid-century informational shorts and army training videos for a wary American public living in the Reagan Era. Despite pulling from such disparate sources, directors Jayne Loader and the Rafferty brothers successfully reconstruct an overarching narrative of the anxiety, dark humor, and empty reassurances that proliferated during the Cold War.</p>

          <p>As fishing ships burst into flames across the Pacific, the Japanese government is horrified to find the culprit to be a prehistoric leviathan, awakened by hydrogen bomb tests in the Bikini Atoll. Both a timeless portrayal of national paranoia and a reimagination of the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, <i>Godzilla</i> stands the test of time as a condemnation of mankind’s ever-mounting destructive nature and the immortal debut of the King of the Monsters.</p>

          <h3>Sidney Lumet &middot; 112m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>When a critical system malfunction directs a group of nuclear-armed U.S. bombers to strike Moscow, the President scrambles to deflect them and prevent mutually assured destruction (sound familiar?). But whereas its twin film <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> played the nuclear threat as a dark political satire, <i>Fail Safe</i> gravely reminds us that even technical mistakes and political miscommunication cannot be treated lightly when Armageddon is but a button press away.</p>

Preceded by Chris Marker's masterful sci-fi short, <i>La Jetée</i>.</p>
