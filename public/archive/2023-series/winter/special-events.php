          <h3>Lukas Dhont &middot; 105m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>His first film after his feature debut and Cannes Caméra d'Or-winning <i>Girl</i>, Lukas Dhont's <i>Close</i> stars Eden Dambrine and Gustav de Waele as two young teen boys, Léo and Rémi. Partially a retelling of Dhont's own childhood experiences, Léo and Rémi must navigate their relationship under new and unwanted scrutiny after returning to their normal lives following an idyllic summer together. Dhont took home the Grand Prix at Cannes for this film.</p>
          <p><i>Free pre-release screening! Followed by discussion and Q+A with director Lukas Dhont moderated by CMST Professor Aurore Spiers.</i></p>

          <h3>Emma Pildes and Tia Lessin &middot; 102m &middot; DCP (English Subtitles)</h3>
          <p>Nearly 50 years before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, seven Chicago women were arrested and charged with building an underground network to provide illegal abortions—each facing up to 110 years in prison. These were 'the Janes,' an activist group which provided abortions to an estimated 11,000 women. This documentary, which includes interviews with the women of the collective, is an informative and vital viewing in a post-Roe America.</p>

          <p><i><span style="color:red;">Free event! Passholders must reserve a ticket online or go through the ticketing table the day of.

          <p>The relationship between lifelong companions Pádraic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson) is suddenly thrown into turmoil when Colm abruptly ends the friendship. Refusing to give up easily, Pádraic determinedly sets out to repair the situation with help from his sister Siobhán and the island delinquent, Dominic. An ultimately gruesome tragicomedy, <i>The Banshees of Inisherin</i> is what Rotten Tomatoes dubs "a finely crafted feel-bad treat".</p>
