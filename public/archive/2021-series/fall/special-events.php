          <h2>Les Indes Galantes (2019)</h2>
          <h3>Clément Cogitore &middot; 230m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>A recording of the 2019 landmark production of <i>Les Indes Galantes</i> at the Opéra-Bastille in Paris, followed by a live Q&A with choreographer Bintou Dembélé. Jean-Philippe Rameau's 1735 opera-ballet is divided into four parts, set in the Ottoman Empire, Peru, Persia, and North America respectively. While each act has a different plot, all of them center a love story, as Cupid has decided to abandon Europe in favor of the more amorous "Indies."</p>

          <h3>Alberto Cavalcanti, Charles Crichton, Basil Dearden, and Robert Hamer &middot; 77m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Slipping past a wartime ban on horror films, <i>Dead of Night</i> remains a key film in the horror anthology genre. An architect is disturbed by déjà vu while visiting a country mansion, realizing that he has been there in a dream—one which ends terribly. The four other guests then recount their own bizarre experiences (each directed by a different star director). <i>Dead of Night</i> introduced many horror tropes, most notably the possessed ventriloquist's doll.</p>

          <h2>The Birds (1963)</h2>
          <h3>Alfred Hitchcock &middot; 119m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>The Birds</i> offers audiences the type of “gorgeous good fun” (<i>The Washington Post</i>) that only Alfred Hitchcock can provide. Set in a seaside town beleaguered by mysterious bird attacks, Hitchcock provides audiences with a dose of his classic crowd-pleasing suspense. Based on a short story of the same name, it initially opened to mixed reviews but is now regarded as one of Hitchcock’s best and has been selected for preservation by the Library of Congress.</p>
