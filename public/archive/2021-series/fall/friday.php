          <h2>Shiva Baby (2020)</h2>
          <h3>Emma Seligman &middot; 77m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>An aimless liberal arts student (Rachel Sennott) attends a Jewish funeral service with her parents, and then spends the afternoon stumbling from one claustrophobic encounter to the next. Emma Seligman's directorial debut is at once agonizing, relevant, and hilarious. In under 90 minutes, Seligman accomplishes a searingly accurate portrait of local Jewish communities and a refreshingly subtle exploration of gender, sexuality, and family.</p>

          <h3>Leos Carax &middot; 139m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>At once a rock opera, a romance, a fantasy, and a family drama, Carax's English-language debut defies classification. Henry, a shock comedian played by a wild Adam Driver, and Ann, a world-famous opera singer played by Marion Cotillard, stir tabloids with their unlikely romance. Their relationship is upended by the birth of their daughter. With a screenplay and score by the rock duo Sparks, <i>Annette</i> is an explosive musical parable of fame and parenthood.</p>

          <h2>The Green Knight (2021)</h2>
          <h3>David Lowery &middot; 130m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>The Green Knight</i> retells an Arthurian tale where a young Sir Gawain (Dev Patel) embarks on a quest to challenge the half-man, half-tree Green Knight. He journeys through lush wilderness and misty castles, all soaked with breathtaking atmospheric light, to reach what may well be his end. The slow spiral of Gawain's odyssey is wrapped in layers of esotericism, containing little of the traditional heroics of legend, but all of its weight and poetry.</p>

          <p>16-year-old Alexis is interested in Death, he tells us, "with a capital D." Perhaps this begins after his boat capsizes in the English Channel—or perhaps it begins with David, the hunky older teenager who saves Alexis, introduced by him as "the corpse I knew when it was alive." Ozon's seductive tale of first love and first loss, <i>Summer of 85</i> features motorcycles zipping along the coast of Normandy, handsome Frenchmen, and the music of Rod Stewart.</p>

When Rob is assaulted and his pig stolen, he reaches out to the young Amir (Alex Wolff), who buys his truffles, for help. Our hermitic protagonist must then go back to Portland and face his old life in this tale of loneliness, cooking, and grief, all in an attempt to get his beloved pet back.</p>

          <p>"Y’all wanna hear a story about why me and this b---- fell out?” A 148-Tweet thread becomes a 90-minute tear across Florida for Zola (Taylour Paige) and her new friend Stefani (Riley Keough) in Janicza Bravo's <i>Zola</i>. A weekend trip in search of big money at a Florida strip club whirlwinds into a tangle of pimps, johns, glitter, and guns, where social media, sex work, and questions of culture and privilege are examined through a neon-soaked lens.</p>

          <p>In the fifteen years that Wayland (Pablo Schreiber) was in prison, his high school sweetheart Dolores (Jena Malone) kept busy—she had three kids with three different fathers. Now on the outside, Wayland and Dolores both must adjust and find stability with each other as they try to rekindle their flame. The foggy melancholia of the Oregon woods sets the tone in newcomer Sabrina Doyle's compassionate portrait of life on the American fringes.</p>

          <h2>Candyman (2021)</h2>
          <h3>Nia DaCosta &middot; 91m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Set in Chicago’s Cabrini-Green neighborhood, <i>Candyman</i> is producer Jordan Peele’s (<i>Get Out</i>) take on the 90s cult horror film series. Both thrilling and terrifying, the film embeds social commentary into the franchise’s mythology. It follows a newcomer to the neighborhood who accidentally unleashes a wave of violence, and will leave you wary to use the bathroom at Ida Noyes afterwards, lest someone accidentally summons the ghost with a hook for a hand.</p>
