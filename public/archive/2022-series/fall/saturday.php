          <h2>Elvis (2022)</h2>
          <h3>Baz Luhrmann &middot; 159m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Directed by Baz Luhrmann, <i>Elvis</i> explores the life of the iconic Elvis Presley. As a biographical musical drama, it displays the complexities of Elvis' character and his relationships, as well as containing an all-star soundtrack contributed to by Doja Cat, Eminem and Stevie Nicks, among others. Not only does this film capture the life of Elvis and the music he gained fame for, it also captures the social and political landscape of the time.</p>

          <h2>Top Gun: Maverick (2022)</h2>
          <h3>Joseph Kosinski &middot; 130m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A feature-length Navy recruitment ad that also doubles as one of the best movies of the year, <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i> is Tom Cruise saving the box office like he said he would. Cruise returns as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, now confronting mortality as he trains a new crop of cocky fighter pilots to carry out a mission against a conspicuously unnamed enemy. The result is a marriage of cinema and propaganda so glorious, Zhang Yimou probably shed a tear.</p>

          <h2>Apples (2020)</h2>
          <h3>Christos Nikou &middot; 91m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Christos Nikou’s acclaimed debut feature, which he co-wrote, co-produced, and directed prior to COVID-19, takes place amid a different kind of pandemic: all around the world, people are randomly falling prey to amnesia. The therapy prescribed to the victims is to engage in stereotypical ‘life experiences’ and document these on Polaroids. This surreal premise, infused with deadpan humor, belies the meditation on loss that lies at the heart of the film.</p>

          <h2>Bullet Train (2022)</h2>
          <h3>David Leitch &middot; 126m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A good, old-fashioned star vehicle for Brad Pitt and a motley assortment of beloved cinema himbos, <i>Bullet Train</i> crams together yakuza gangs, international hitmen, and a rogue Channing Tatum cameo onto a high-speed imagination of the Tokaido Shinkansen. David Leitch of <i>John Wick</i> fame directs as Pitt’s reformed bagman finds a simple grab-and-go job going horribly off the rails. If anything, this film dares to ask: How much is <i>too</i> much movie?</p>

          <h2>RRR (2022)</h2>
          <h3>S. S. Rajamouli &middot; 181m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>RRR</i> is an exhilarating, action-packed spectacular mythologizing two real-life freedom fighters who helped lead India’s fight for independence from the British Raj: village guardian Komaram Bheem and Alluri Sitarama Raju, an ambitious Imperial officer. Set in the 1920s before their fight for India’s independence began, <i>RRR</i> imagines a fictional meeting between them, set into motion when a young Gond girl is stolen from her village by British soldiers. </p>

          <h2>Autoerótica (2021) — US Premiere</h2>
          <h3>Andrea Hoyos &middot; 92m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>Join us at Doc for the <b>US premiere</b> of <i>Autoerótica</i>! <i>Autoerótica</i> tells the story of Bruna, a teenage girl exploring her sexuality in modern-day Peru, and weaves the cringiest, true-to-life details of adolescence with quietly angry, biting social commentary. A tale of female friendship and the struggle for reproductive justice, Andrea Hoyos' directorial debut is a fiery work that marks the beginning of a new voice in contemporary Latin American cinema.</p>
