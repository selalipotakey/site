          <h1>WEDNESDAY - A Guy Maddin Retrospective…</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by: Penny Folger</h3>

            <p>Guy Maddin's films have been referred to by critic Jonathan Rosenbaum as "deranged heterosexual camp," but the label seems to have been given with a great deal of affection for the director's work. Stepping into a Guy Maddin film is often like stepping into another universe entirely: one laced with melodrama, pathos, humor, hockey players, and gentlemen who use fish guts as hair pomade. Often working with very low budgets, Maddin uses experimental techniques such as smearing Vaseline around the edges of his lenses; shooting in a wild collage of varying low-res formats; frenetic editing and theatrical, often humorous title cards, in a whirlwind style that not only acts as a throwback to our own cinema history, but also transforms it into a more contemporary, dreamlike, and humorous vision that is unlike any other.</p>

            <p> </p>

            <p>A kind of melodrama that is often lathered to the point of deadpan comedy, his movies involve topics including but not limited to: amnesia, sexual repression, romantic despair, revenge, sinister orphanages, incestuous longings, amputees, hailstorms of bunny rabbits, the aforementioned ice hockey players, ballet, and a baroness with glass beer bottle legs who says about her search to find the saddest song on Earth, “If you’re sad and like beer, I’m your lady.” </p>

            <p>Come see his movies on the big screen; they’re well deserving of it.</p>

          <h3>Guy Maddin &middot; 90m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>In the Arkhangelsk region of Russia in 1919, a one-legged Canadian solider and victim of amnesia (by way of mustard gas) mistakes a nurse for his dead wife. Meanwhile, her own husband, suffering the same affliction, forgets that he is married. Filmed in a style reminiscent of the late silent to early talkie era of cinema, <i>Archangel</i> is perhaps the only film fictionalizing the Bolshevik Revolution that features an invasion of bunny rabbits.</p>

          <p>Maddin underlines the erotic horror lurking in Bram Stoker's story as well as infusing it with his signature humor with title cards like, "She's filled with polluted blood!" Dracula is interpreted by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, set to Mahler and shot like a silent film on low-res formats including 16mm and Super 8. Admittedly not a fan of ballet or Dracula when first commissioned, Maddin transcends preconceptions about either into a work all his own.</p>

          <p>Originally intended to be 10 short films seen through a series of peepholes, this is the first in Maddin's autobiographical trilogy which includes <i>Brand Upon the Brain!</i> and <i>My Winnipeg</i>. Shot on Super 8 in the style of a frenetic silent film, we visit themes of betrayal, revenge and regret. Maddin blends melodrama and pathos with humor—featuring a ghost, a beauty salon-bordello combo, and his signature hockey players. Preceded by <i>Sissy Boy Slap Party</i>.</p>

          <p>“If you are sad and like beer, I'm your lady.” Taking place at the end of Prohibition and filmed in a style reminiscent of that era, Lady Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini), a beer baroness amputee with glass beer bottles for legs, holds an Olympic-style competition to find the saddest music in the world. Meanwhile, an old timey villain—played by The Kids in the Hall’s Mark McKinney—plots to win it. Preceded by <i>The Heart of the World</i>.</p>

          <p>Originally titled "Love Me, Love My Winnipeg," this surrealist pseudo-documentary/mockumentary mythologizes Winnipeg history and Maddin's own childhood through the blending of fact, fantasy and memory. Claiming Winnipeg has 10x more sleepwalkers than any other city, he reenacts childhood memories at his parents' 65th anniversary celebration (despite his father having been dead for some years) in their old family home above a beauty parlor.</p>
