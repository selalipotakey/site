          <h3>David Lynch // Denis Villeneuve &middot; 137m // 155m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Lynch was approached to adapt this seemingly unadaptable sci-fi staple on the strength of his <i>Elephant Man</i> receiving eight Oscar nominations. He was given a huge-for-its-time budget and a stacked cast (including mega rockstar Sting), but not the final cut of the film. His truncated vision bombed, but eventually gained a cult following for its fever-dream imagery, kinky grotesquerie, and camp strangeness. In this adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, hero's journey and geopolitical allegory come together into one of 2021's most anticipated movies. Paul Atreides must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to secure the future of his family and his people. Malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence: a commodity capable of unlocking humanity's greatest potential. Join us for a <i>Dune</i> double feature!</p>

          <h3>Julia Ducournau &middot; 108m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A Palme d'Or-winning work of body horror, Julia Ducournau delivers a film evading description. The French-Belgian co-production stars Agathe Rousselle in her feature film debut as Alexia, a woman who, after being injured in a car accident as a child, has a titanium plate fitted in her head.  This is a work about love, rage, and loneliness, expressed through outlandish physical metaphors, finding lineage in the works of David Cronenberg.</p>

          <h3>Wes Anderson &middot; 108m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Inspired by the director's love of <i>The New Yorker</i>, Wes Anderson's latest film centres the staff and stories of a magazine called <i>The French Dispatch</i>. When the newspaper's editor, Arthur Howitzer Jr., dies suddenly of a heart attack, the newspaper staff decide to publish a memorial edition highlighting the three best stories from the last decade: an artist sentenced to life imprisonment, student riots, and a kidnapping resolved by a chef.</p>

          <h3>Valdimar Jóhannsson &middot; 106m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Icelandic director Vladimar Jóhannsson's feature debut is an outrageous fantasy thriller, co-written by lyricist and Björk-collaborator Sjón. It centers María and Ingvar, an unhappy couple living on a mountainous farm in Iceland, who have lost their only child. When one of their pregnant sheep gives birth to a half-lamb/half-human hybrid, a sense of family is renewed among the couple. But will their newfound joy last, or will the loneliness creep back in?</p>

          <h3>Mike Mills &middot; 110m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>In Mike Mills’ refreshingly sensitive tale of the relationships between adults and children, Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny, an audio producer who interviews kids about the future, but never stops to think about it himself. But when Johnny’s sister asks him to take care of her inquisitive son Jesse (Woody Norman), Johnny is thrust into the world of quasi-parenthood, which opens him up to a newfound appreciation of the world and the love it has to offer.</p>

          <h3>Cary Joji Fukunaga &middot; 163m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Daniel Craig returns for the fifth and final time as James Bond, now retired from MI6, reluctantly drawn back into service in response to an international power grab over a terrifying new bioweapon. When it falls into the wrong hands, Bond must team up with his old agency (and his lost lover) to save the world, if he can manage.  Léa Seydoux returns as Madeleine Swann in a chilling performance that may not let you leave without tear-stained cheeks.</p>
