          <h1>THURSDAY 2 - Punks Behind the Camera</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by: Eli Timoner</h3>

            <p>It’s much easier to define punk by what it isn’t than what it is. When punk first percolated from working class discontents out of the shadow of arena rock excesses, there was a certain look and sound that punk took: leather jackets, power chords, guttural screams, shaved heads…you know the blueprint. But more than the look or the sound it was an attitude—a rejection of heterodoxy in all forms. Left behind in a world of accelerating capitalism, they saw no future, as many of us do now — so they made a hedonistic world that spat in the faces of squares instead. It was fresh, radical, DIY in its methods. But after those early days punk splintered quickly. New Wave and No Wave took the experimental spotlight of the early 80s, and the widespread popularity of punk subculture emptied it of its original urgency and authenticity—to many of punk’s early progenitors, punk had died.</p>

            <p>But if punk is dead, the spirit of punk still lives on, in all its transgressive, DIY, no-compromises, often trashy glory. With this series I have attempted to display some of the best products of this ethos. It’s called “Punks Behind the Camera,” not “Punks in Front of the Camera,” for this reason: in this series you will not find conventional movies that feature punks merely as stock characters, or documentaries historicizing the punk phenomenon. The films I have chosen are (perhaps with the exception of WE ARE THE BEST!) films born from punk auteurs and their spiritual progeny. These films, and this movement, have had a profound impact on the development of the indie film in the last half century: SMITHEREENS was the first American indie to win the Palm D’Or, LIQUID SKY, an avant-garde low-budget movie made by Soviets in America was a runaway commercial success, and New Queer Cinema simply would not have come to be without Bruce LaBruce or the trailblazing spirit of punkdom. Yet despite their importance and popularity, most of these films are still hard to find. Many titles are not on streaming platforms, and theatrical retrospectives are even more rare. Take this series as an opportunity for introduction to the urgency and fearless experimentation of a canon that defies expectation.</p>

          <p>In Susan Seidelman’s feature directorial debut, young and talentless Wren (Susan Berman) has dreams of becoming famous in downtown New York’s disappearing punk scene. In the meantime, she gets entangled with drifters and washed-up punk rocker Eric (Richard Hell), who makes promises of leaving to L.A. where punk is still alive. Shot on 16mm with a budget of $40,000, this lo-fi gem was the first American indie to be nominated for the Palme d’Or.</p>

          <p>Adrian (Paula Sheppard) and her fashion model girlfriend Margaret (Anne Carlisle) navigate the cutthroat, drug-fueled, impeccably styled modelling world of early-80s downtown NYC. But ever since a small UFO landed on their rooftop, Margaret’s sexual partners are struck dead when she brings them to climax — and she must learn to wield her powers wisely. This irreverant, punky, technicolor noir became one of the biggest indie hits of the decade.</p>

An experimental, deeply satirical, and unabashedly trashy fever dream for those who wish John Waters was more 'out-there.'</p>

          <h3>Dennis Hopper &middot; 94m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Led by a captivating performance from the late Linda Manz. CeBe, the child of a drug addict mother and an abusive imprisoned father, takes refuge in the no-future attitude of punk rock, running away from home for the Vancouver punk scene where she lives a degenerate life of freedom. When her family tries to reunite, however, her world takes a dark turn. Often compared to Hopper's earlier <i>Easy Rider</i>, this poetic reflection on alienation and inheritance is one you won't soon forget.</p>

          <h2>Multiple Maniacs (1970)</h2>
          <h3>John Waters &middot; 90m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>Multiple Maniacs</i> follows The Cavalcade of Perversion, a traveling troupe of fetish acts and obscenities. Lady Divine and her lover Mr. David routinely rob the show’s spectators at gunpoint, until she gets bored and decides to murder them as well. Waters stated that the final scene in the film was inspired by Salvador Dali, a postcard featuring a giant lobster, and a mix of LSD and cannabis. Described as “smelly” and “thoroughly disgusting” by critics, yet carrying Waters’ distinct brand of black humor, this film is a treat—for those who can stomach it.</p>
