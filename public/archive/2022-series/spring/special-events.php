          <h3>Nobuhiko Obayashi &middot; 88m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p><i>House</i> is definitively the most bizarre and beautiful horror film ever put to the screen. Following a group of seven girls visiting the country home of one of their aunts, director Obayashi crafts a delirious re-treatment of a classic horror narrative: everything in the house isn't quite what it seems. With expert cinematography, wholly unique editing, and a soundtrack made by a haunting earworm melody, <i>House</i> is a must-see for moviegoers everywhere.</p>

          <h3>Sean Ellis &middot; 120m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Starring Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan as Slovak and Czech soldiers Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, this film follows the events of Operation Anthropoid, the Allied plan to assassinate SS mastermind Reinhard Heydrich in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. With limited outside help, Jozef and Jan carry out the attack, but a terrible reprisal is still to follow. <i>Anthropoid</i> was praised for its realism and close retelling of events, as historical reports were used to recreate the assassination scene.</p>
