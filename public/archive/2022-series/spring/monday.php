          <h1>MONDAY - An Open Window: Black Female Directors Across the Diaspora</h1>
          <h3>Programmed by: Erisa Apantaku and J. Michael Eugenio</h3>

            <p>“There’s something really important about stories about Black women and girls being told by Black women. [They] give you a reflection, as opposed to an interpretation, of what our lives are like.”</p>

            <p>-Ava DuVernay</p>

            <p>Work by contemporary Black women directors such as Dee Rees, Nia DaCosta, and Ava DuVernay is on the rise in the past decade. These directors have received recognition and wide releases, leading to a resurrection and rebirth of work from predecessors like Julie Dash and Kasi Lemmons. But there is always more to uncover. Black women have been involved in filmmaking since the origin of the medium, and their films exist across the Black Diaspora. From documenting political resistance to personal struggle, the short and feature-length films in this series demonstrate the myriad aesthetics employed by Black women directors to tell their stories over the past five decades. In “An Open Window,” we invite you to take a glimpse into work that has often been left unseen.</p>

In tribute to the late Sarah Maldoror: her first and favorite film, <i>Monangambee</i>, named after the Angolan anti-colonial call for a village meeting; her first TV film, <i>A Dessert for Constance</i>, full of immigrant joy, homesickness, and solidarity; and her impassioned <i>Léon G. Damas</i>, meditating on the Négritude poet.</p>

          <p><i>An Open Window</i> is a film about mental illness among Dakar’s street wanderers. After shooting, Sylla fell ill, “seeing what others don’t see—the dislocated eye, the ancientness of the glass bubble, a sky descended too low, a horizon far too near. I was living the experience from the inside.” Fronza Wood’s <i>Killing Time</i> is a dark comedy about finding the right outfit to commit suicide in. The New Yorker calls it “among the best short films ever made." After becoming the first Black woman in the New York camera operators' union, Jessie Maple turned to directing. In <i>Twice As Nice</i>, twin basketball players compete to become the first woman in the “MBA.” The film stars real-life powerhouses Pamela and Paula McGhee, who led USC to back-to-back NCAA championships in the 1980s, and Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. Preceded by Onwurah’s Coffee Coloured Children, an affecting meditation on internalized racism.</p>
