          <h2>The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021)</h2>
          <h3>Joel Coen &middot; 105m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The first film directed by just one Coen brother, <i>The Tragedy of Macbeth</i> is anything but a tragedy for Joel Coen. Acclaimed by critics and nominated for three Academy Awards, this black-and-white retelling of Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i> is a surreal production that captures the feeling of the stage. The film is led by Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand as Lord and Lady Macbeth, with longtime Coen Brothers composer Carter Burwell producing the score.</p>

          <h3>Edgar Wright &middot; 116m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>In this time-twisting, fashion-filled thriller, Anya Taylor-Joy plays Ellie, a country girl and aspiring fashion designer who has just moved to London, but can't seem to fit in. She's at first inspired by visions of a confident and mysterious blonde girl from the 1960s in her dreams, but when her world begins to bleed into Ellie's, a new nightmare begins—all set against a soundtrack of classic '60s songs, some of which inspired sequences in the film.</p>

          <h3>Paul Thomas Anderson &middot; 133m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Starring Cooper Hoffman (son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman), Alana Haim, and a star-filled supporting cast, Paul Thomas Anderson weaves a coming-of-age romance between high school student and young actor Gary Valentine and the decade-older photographer's assistant Alana Kane in the San Fernando Valley of 1973. An homage to young love, California, and everything '70s, the film is shot in quintessential Anderson style, reminiscent of <i>Boogie Nights</i>.</p>

          <h2>Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)</h2>
          <h3>Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert &middot; 146m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>At once a heartfelt family drama and an irreverent, multiverse-hopping sci-fi comedy, <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i> centers around a frazzled Chinese-American mother (Michelle Yeoh) tossed into the center of an interdimensional whirlwind of chaos. Rife with thoughtful details of Asian-American life, stuck-on googly eyes, and starring Jamie Lee Curtis as a diabolical IRS inspector, this film has a little something for everyone.</p>
