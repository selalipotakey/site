          <h2>Spinning Home Movies: “Time Travelin’” (2021)</h2>
          <h3>Cam Be &middot; 30m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>“Time Travelin’” features vintage home movie footage from the South Side Home Movie Project archives, curated and soundtracked by Chicago’s own director, photographer, musician, DJ, and producer Cam Be. Through a collage of home movie footage, including from Cam’s own personal archives, “Time Travelin​’” explores the interconnectedness of human beings generations apart. Whether it’s the beauty that surrounds us or the moments that connect us, our smile radiates the same. Unforgettable moments in this mix include crowd scenes and sweet audio clips from Chicago Fest 1979, and mid-1950s dance club scenes from the Roberts Show Lounge.</p>
          <p><i>Originally aired virtually on May 27, 2021, this live re-screening will be followed by discussion with Cam Be and SSHMP’s Spinning Home Movies series producer Avery LaFlamme.</i></p>
