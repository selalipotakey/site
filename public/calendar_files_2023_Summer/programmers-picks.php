          <h3>Robert Altman &middot; 160m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The damndest thing you ever saw. Widely regarded as one of Robert Altman’s best works, this all-American satirical epic spans religion, music, and politics. <i>Nashville</i> covers the five days leading up to a presidential candidate gala through the eyes of a massive, 24-person ensemble cast, including an up-and-coming Lily Tomlin, Altman regular Shelley Duvall, and country singers Barbara Jean and Connie White. Bursting at the seams with plot lines, characters, and musical numbers, this grand story captures the county music capital in all its glory, and is the perfect way to ring in this 4th of July weekend.</p>

          <h2>The Searchers (1956)</h2>
          <h3>John Ford &middot; 119m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>The beloved middle-child western sandwiched between the old-school and revisionists, The Searchers takes a decidedly complex look at one man’s delirious search for his abducted niece. Closer in spirit to Heart of Darkness than Gunsmoke, John Ford subtly questions the ideologies of the American west and its isolated inhabitants driven to humanity’s edge. With the mesmerizing imagery of Monument Valley as a backdrop for the likes of John Wayne and Natalie Wood, The Searchers serves as a touchstone for one of American cinema’s earliest reckonings with the racism of the American west(ern).</p>
