          <h3>Albert Serra &middot; 162m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>This post-colonial fever dream of French Polynesia was voted best film of 2022 by <i>Cahiers du Cinéma</i> and "suggests John le Carré by way of David Lynch," per A.O. Scott. It's a slow-burning character study of High Commissioner De Roller (Benoît Magimel, <i>The Piano Teacher</i>), who floats through all walks of island life with an easy charisma. But the lush Tahitian setting pulses with a sense of dread that only grows as political alliances shift and unravel.</p>
