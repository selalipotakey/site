                    <p class="capsule fittext">Nearly 50 years before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, seven Chicago women were arrested and charged with building an underground network to provide illegal abortions—each facing up to 110 years in prison. These were 'the Janes,' and this is their story.

          <h3>Wayne Wang &middot; 76m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>"<i>Chan is Missing</i> announced that Asian Americans could be artists," remembers scholar Peter Feng. An audacious mix of noir and documentary, it follows a manhunt for Chan Hung, who becomes a stand-in for Chinese American identity itself, as no one can agree who he is, or was. Chan is never found: to be Asian American is not to inhabit a single preexisting identity, but to negotiate a new, unstable one, forging solidarities where they didn't exist before.</p>

          <h3>Jean Renoir &middot; 82m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>In the midst of the Great Depression, Renoir used a true crime story and non-professional actors to show the plight of migrant workers as they struggled in the south of France. Toni is a laborer from Italy loved by his landlady, but he becomes obsessed with Josepha, a new migrant worker from Spain. Josepha then falls in love with a Frenchman, and the conflict of wills leads to inevitable tragedy. Uniquely for 1935, <i>Toni</i>  was entirely filmed on location.</p>

          <p>A Greek family living in Istanbul is broken apart when they are deported from Turkey; the family's young son, Fanis, struggles to adapt to life in Greece and takes refuge in cooking, as it is his only connection to his grandfather and his homeland. The film's original title, <i>Politiki Kouzina</i>, can either be translated as "Cuisine of the City" (referring to Constantinople) or as "Political Cuisine," reflecting the dual themes underpinning this film.</p>

          <h3>Ingmar Bergman &middot; 81m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The second film of Ingmar Berman’s “spiritual” trilogy, <i>Winter Light</i> focuses on Tomas Ericsson, a pastor stricken with a personal crisis in faith, as he delivers a service for a small congregation including a fisherman debilitatingly frightened by nuclear war to Ericsson’s atheist ex-mistress. Profound in its depiction of existentialism and faith on an individual scale, the film harshly ponders God’s absence, silence, and love for His creations.</p>

          <p>Long before writer/director Maren Ade rocketed to international acclaim with the comedy <i>Toni Erdmann</i>, she showed a talent for finding humor and psychological depth in the drudgery of everyday life. Her directorial debut <i>The Forest for the Trees</i> focuses on the struggles of an awkward young teacher (Eva Löbau) starting over in a new town. The distinctly lo-fi video aesthetic highlights the growing desperation within Löbrau’s subtle performance.</p>

Attempting to cope with his deteriorating psyche, he delves deeper and deeper into a spiral of self-destruction in one of this series' most subtle features.

          <p>Inspired by—but in no way limited to—true historical events, Gina Prince-Bythewood's most recent release <i>The Woman King</i> stars Viola Davis as the titular leader of the Agojie, a group of warrior women who protected the African kingdom of Dahomey (modern-day Benin) in the 1800s.

          <h3>Victor Sjöström &middot; 106m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>Cited by Ingmar Bergman as a major influence on his own work, <i>The Phantom Carriage</i> is an indisputable classic of ghoulish Swedish cinema. Released itself on New Year's Day, 1921, the film begins on New Year's Eve, as violent alcoholic David Holm and his drinking buddies share the story of the Phantom Carriage. Legend has it that the last great sinner to die each year will have to drive the eponymous chariot, collecting the souls of the dead for a year...</p>
