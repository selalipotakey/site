          <p>Suspecting each other of infidelity, Jerry (Cary Grant) and Lucy (Irene Dunne) file for divorce, which takes effect after 90 days. Soon after, each spouse realizes they still love the other, and both begin sabotaging each other’s new romances. Leo McCarey won an Oscar for his direction, and screwball stalwarts Ralph Bellamy and Skippy the Dog round out the cast. Earnest and hilarious, <i>The Awful Truth</i> is a celebration of love in all its messy glory.</p>

          <h2>Girls Always Happy (2018)</h2>
          <h3>Yang Mingming &middot; 116min &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>Yang Mingming's <i>Girls Always Happy</i> is a revelation in 21st century Chinese cinema. Blending comedy and drama in equal measure and featuring a toxic familial relationship that rivals the chaos of <i>Ladybird</i> and early Xavier Dolan, simultaneous writer/actor/director Yang Mingming's debut is a criminally underrated glimpse at a particularly fucked up Beijing duo of a mid-twenties daughter living with her mother in a cramped house.</p>

When Hong Kong is threatened by a subterranean villain kidnapping babies for nefarious ends, the trio must set their differences aside, band together to form the titular <i>Heroic Trio</i>, and save the city.

          <h3>Vittorio Taviani & Paolo Taviani &middot; 76m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>In a high-security Roman prison, inmates prepare to put on a production of "Julius Caesar." With current and former inmates as actors and shot in stark black and white, <i>Caesar Must Die</i> follows the thorny road of the production from audition to performance, shrouding the seam between documentary and fiction. Director Paolo Taviani hoped the film would show that "even a prisoner with a dreadful sentence, even a life sentence, is and remains a human being."</p>

After the Shah is deposed, Marji must navigate her interests in counter-culture, education, and boys in the face of the Islamic fundamentalist government. <i>Persepolis</i> is simultaneously a film about coming-of-age, politics, and womanhood, all told through Satrapi's signature graphic novel style.</p>

Scary, cringy, funny, and infinitely quotable, <i>Get Out</i> has quickly become one of the best American films of the millennium.

          <h2>Out 1: Spectre (1972)</h2>
          <h3>Jacques Rivette &middot; 264min &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>This condensed version of Rivette’s 13-hour magnum opus, <i>Out 1: Noli Me Tangere</i>, has been hailed as a masterpiece in its own right. Entirely improvised, it tells the story of two outsiders investigating a conspiracy involving avant-garde theater troupes and an Illuminati-like secret society. In the words of critic Jonathan Romney, the film is “about things, people, and communal causes falling apart, arguably a lament for France’s failed utopia of 1968.”</p>
