                  </a>
                  <p class="capsule fittext">One of the most acclaimed films of the 21st-century, <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i> follows a stolen mystical sword and two warriors’ (Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh) quest to retrieve it. Grand in its scope and mesmerizing in its execution—in part due to Yuen Woo-Ping’s intricate, masterfully-crafted fight choreography—Ang Lee’s film is an enthralling visual experience not to be missed.</p>

                  </a>
                  <p class="capsule fittext">Whether prescient or dated, we aren’t exactly sure. 2000s bright-eyed Zuckerberg collides with David Fincher’s cinematic sleekness and Sorkin’s verbose pizzazz. <i>The Social Network</i> dissects social media's birth at a microcosmic level: a who’s who of dorky college dropouts and deadbeats opening the Pandora’s box that would become Facebook. Ideal for freshmen entering college life, the movie features a killer score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.</p>

                  <p class="capsule fittext">Harold is a morose young man whose obsession with death is distasteful to his wealthy socialite mother. When he meets Maude, a 79-year-old free spirit who lives life to the fullest—even in spite of the law—the two strike up an odd friendship and a deep affection. Both a black comedy and an innocent romance, <i>Harold and Maude</i> highlights love that exists between members of society’s strange and outcast, with a classic soundtrack by Cat Stevens.</p>

          <h3>Fritz Lang &middot; 110m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>In a city plagued by a shocking series of child murders, the cops and the criminals alike organize to catch the killer. Scripted by Lang’s wife Thea von Harbou, this stunning work was Lang’s first sound film and his own personal favorite. <i>M</i> combines dazzling visual and sonic inventiveness with an incisive critique of an entire society. Peter Lorre’s extraordinary performance as the killer manages to be both terrifying and sympathetic.</p>

          <h3>Albert, David Maysles, and Charlotte Zwerin &middot; 91m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The door-to-door salesmen in this Maysles brothers documentary aren’t exactly preachers—but they are in the business of religion as they try to sell large, expensive Bibles to working-class Catholics. A portrait of mid-century consumerism and suburban ennui, <i>Salesman</i> follows its subjects from house to house as they pitch the Good Book and swap notes about the day’s successes and failures.</p>

          <h3>Ang Lee &middot; 134m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>It’s hard to overstate the significance of <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>. Devastatingly beautiful and incredibly profound, the film revolves around the secret, decades-long relationship between cowboys Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jack Gyllenhaal). <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> is both a brilliant and important film that won Ang Lee the Academy Award for Best Director and proved that serious LGBTQ stories belong in mainstream media. Doc was actually the Chicago premiere for this film!</p>

          <h3>Josh and Benny Safdie &middot; 135m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Telling the tale of Howie Ratner (Adam Sandler), a Diamond District mogul who always defaults to ante, this Safdie Brothers joint will push your palm sweat into overdrive as Howie’s successive parlays become more outlandish than the last. With a cast including LaKeith Stanfield, The Weeknd, Kevin Garnett himself, and seemingly every 2010s New York <i>character</i>, <i>Uncut Gems</i> is a whirlwind of basketball, Passover, and tricked out Furbies. Come for Julia Fox, stay for Oneohtrix Poi—Daniel Lopatin.</p>

          <h3>Abel Ferrara &middot; 96m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Abel Ferrara directs and stars in this overlooked horror masterpiece about a painter whose lack of success, rent, and noisy neighbors cause him to begin a murder rampage around the city with a power drill. Cleverly capturing many of the anxieties induced by the city and offering one of the strangest performances you’ll see from an actor, <i>The Driller Killer</i> is one of few movies to have a no-wave soundtrack, which complements the atmosphere perfectly.</p>

          <h3>David Lynch &middot; 134m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Fred, a Los Angeles saxophonist, continuously recieves VHS tapes of his home, which become increasingly cryptic. Meanwhile, he has surreal dreams which cause him to suspect that his wife is not exactly who she seems. One of Lynch’s most confounding puzzles, <i>Lost Highway</i> is a frightening dreamscape of memory, identity, and desire better seen than explained.</p>

          <h3>Celine Song &middot; 106m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Celine Song wrote this screenplay for herself, but we're all glad she did. After settling in New York with her husband (John Magaro), Nora encounters her childhood sweetheart Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) and is faced with the lines of fate tying her not only to Hae Sung, but also to who she used to be. Based off of Song's experiences as a Korean immigrant, <i>Past Lives</i> presents a romantic drama that patiently explores inexpressible connections and the what-if’s.</p>

          <h3>Héctor Babenco &middot; 128m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Centered around the titular child gangster who must constantly escape the threat of sexual violence, <i>Pixote</i> calls upon the life experiences of its cast members to create an embodiment of favela life, eschewing tropes of poverty porn in favor of an approach like De Sica's. Featuring a heart-rending performance by Fernando Ramos da Silva, who was killed by police after completing the film, <i>Pixote</i> presents the institutional failings of a modern Brazil in the bleakest manner imaginable.</p>
