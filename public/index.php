                  <p class="capsule fittext">Cronenberg's <i>The Fly</i> takes the question “would you still love me if I were a worm?” a bit too literally. This 1986 film follows the hubristic Dr. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum). However, when something goes horribly wrong with his newest and greatest invention, he very quickly finds that such an idea is not just mere absurdity, but blasphemy too. This grotesque and iconic adaptation of the 1958 original is a masterpiece—in all its gooey pus-filled glory.

          <h3>Marguerite Duras &middot; 91m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>The film’s constant looping soundtrack accompanies a lonely Vera Baxter in an empty villa. A woman (Seyrig) hears Baxter’s name at a bar and is drawn to find her. Seyrig’s unique voice is seldom heard here; instead, she listens as Vera recounts to her the details of how her husband treats her as a commodity. Seyrig's character's presence is mysterious, never explained, yet she is our access to Vera, revealing the emptiness of her life through dialogue.</p>

          <h2>Roma (2018)</h2>
          <h3>Alfonso Cuarón &middot; 135m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>Roma</i> follows Cleo, a housekeeper for a bourgeois 1970s Mexico City family on the brink of being torn apart—only for her own life to be upended by an unexpected pregnancy and militant boyfriend. <i>Roma</i> is a visually stunning, heart-wrenching, and unabashedly human film—a contemporary masterpiece. Receiving 10 Oscar nominations, the film is perhaps Alfonso Cuarón’s most intimate project, rhyming with his own upbringing in CDMX's Colonia Roma neighborhood.</p>

          <h3>Claire Denis &middot; 93m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The youngest film to end up on our list has come to unequivocally shape filmmaking in the 21st century. Based on Melville’s <i>Billy Budd</i>, Denis’ film is a meditative and homoerotically-charged work of stunning beauty and catharsis. A simultaneous critique of colonialism, militarism, and repression, <i>Beau Travail</i> has become a recent favorite of directors like Barry Jenkins and Pablo Larraín. It also features the single greatest needle drop in film history.</p>

Winner of the 2022 Jury Prize at Cannes, <i>EO</i> centers its eponymous donkey, born and raised in a Polish circus, as he travels across the Polish and Italian countryside. Skolimowski's masterful homage to Bresson, released almost sixty years after <i>Au Hasard Balthazar</i>, provides just as frank an image of humanity from the perspective of an animal, in all its kindness and cruelty.</p>

          <p>Spike Jonze got his start as a teenager taking photographs of BMX riders and skateboarders for the <i>Transworld Skateboarding</i> magazine. The style he developed led him to direct music videos and soon after, feature films. <i>Being John Malkovich</i> was Jonze’s feature debut, a collaborative effort with writer Charlie Kaufman. The film follows a puppeteer (John Cusack) who, while working odd-jobs, discovers a hidden portal into the mind of John Malkovich.</p>
