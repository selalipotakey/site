                  <p class="capsule fittext">Cronenberg's <i>The Fly</i> takes the question “would you still love me if I were a worm?” a bit too literally. This 1986 film follows the hubristic Dr. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum). However, when something goes horribly wrong with his newest and greatest invention, he very quickly finds that such an idea is not just mere absurdity, but blasphemy too. This grotesque and iconic adaptation of the 1958 original is a masterpiece—in all its gooey pus-filled glory.

          <h2>The Unspeakable Act (2013)</h2>
          <h3>Dan Sallitt &middot; 91m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A coming-of-age film that is, for once, pleasantly <i>unrelatable</i>, <i>The Unspeakable Act</i> is a film directed by Dan Sallitt about a girl's unrequited romantic love for her older brother. Jackie, a 17-year-old Brooklyn highschooler, prepares for her older brother, Matthew, to leave for college amidst realizations that he's found a girlfriend. <i>The Unspeakable Act</i> toes the line between sincere and taboo and is an intriguing look into adolescence.</p>

          <h3>Dan Sallitt &middot; 94m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>Fourteen</i> is Dan Sallit's latest feature film and first film since <i>the Unspeakable Act</i>. Mara (Tallie Medel) and Jo (Norma Kuhling) are two women who've maintained a close friendship since childhood. While being polar opposites, Mara finds excitement and spontaneity in Jo, and Jo comfort and care in Mara. The film follows their relationship as Jo deteriorates due to a mixture of mental illness and drugs while Mara struggles to keep her head above water.</p>

          <h2>Stolen Kisses (1968)</h2>
          <h3>Francois Truffaut &middot; 90m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>In the third of Truffaut’s Antoine Doinel films, the ever-youthful Antoine (Jeanne Pierre-Léaud) gets a job as a private detective and works undercover at a shoe store. He becomes relatably infatuated with his boss’s wife, Fabienne Tabard (Seyrig), who seduces him with her elegance, magnetic beauty, and charm. In her famous monologue, Fabienne says to Antoine: “I am not an apparition, I am a woman,” a quote which can equally encapsulate Seyrig’s career.</p>

As his health worsens, Uxbal finds himself tasked with settling myriad things in his chaotic life before it’s too late. Bardem shines in this grim film that, fitting with this series’s theme (Three Amigos), names both Cuarón and del Toro as producers.</p>

Upon waking under a neurologist's care, Smith finds that the brain damage he sustained in the crash has left him with psychic abilities, cursing him to see people's futures when he touches them.</p>

          <p>Calling all devotees of Soviet cinema! If you think our usual programming is the opiate of the masses, do we have the picture for you. <i>Man with a Movie Camera</i> is one of the rare cinema 101 works that seemingly everyone loves. Vertov’s revolutionary film, sans intertitles (wowza!), is a masterclass of cutting, framing, throwing everything at the wall, and generally being hyper in a uniquely 1920s way. Preceded by <i>Meshes of the Afternoon</i>.</p>

His first film, <i>La Jetée</i>, was constructed almost entirely from still photographs. Co-directed with Pierre Lhomme, <i>Le Joli Mai</i> is Marker's first feature-length film and documents street interviews with everyday Parisians.</p>
