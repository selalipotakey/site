          <p>In 1975, a French TV show ran a program on the "year of the woman." Feminist video collective Les Insoumuses responded with <i>Maso and Miso</i>, a humorous and disruptive re-edit of the misogynistic show. Followed by a documentary about Seyrig's attempts to make a film about Calamity Jane's letters to her daughter. Babette Mangolte (cinematographer, <i>Jeanne Dielman</i>) interweaves footage and other materials from the incomplete journey in an homage to Seyrig.</p>

          <h3>Alejandro González Iñárritu &middot; 153m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>The film that won Iñárritu his first moment of international stardom, <i>Amores Perros</i> is a gritty portrait of life in Mexico City. The movie tells the interconnected stories of three characters of different social statuses, whose lives are forever changed by a single car crash. The film’s nonlinear narrative structure, powerful performance, and sense of realism make it a gripping, emotionally resonant drama fully deserving of its critical acclaim.</p>

          <h3>David Cronenberg &middot; 115m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>In part an obsessive adaptation of the eponymous 1959 classic and a metabiography of William S. Burroughs himself, <i>Naked Lunch</i> is obscene and beyond strange. It follows “Blank Face Bug Killer” Bill Lee (Peter Weller) and his wife Joan as they get high off their own insecticide supply. When Bill inadvertently kills Joan, it's off to the races: a winding story filled with salacious cockroach typewriters, crawling cities, and so, so many insects.</p>

          <h3>Yasujiro Ozu &middot; 136m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>It’s week 7—we all need a good crying session. <i>Tokyo Story</i> 's movingly epic narrative takes place not across great landscapes, but in confined middle-class Tokyo homes, as an elderly couple visit their family in the bustling postwar metropolis. A hallmark of transcendental filmmaking, Ozu utilizes his signature tatami shots and veteran actors Setsuko Hara and Chishū Ryū to craft a generous, empathetic film about aging in an increasingly chaotic world.</p>

          <h3>Hlynur Pálmason &middot; 143m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Like its Icelandic setting, <i>Godland</i> is beautiful, elemental, and more than 60% Lutheran. Writer-director Pálmason's third film follows Danish missionary Lucas as he journeys across the subarctic island with local guide Ragnar, lugging a hefty <i>fin de siècle</i>  camera across glacial meltwaters, volcanic mudflats, and others stunning landscapes of scarcity. Shot with natural light and in round-edged Academy ratio, <i>Godland</i> is simply sublime.</p>

          <p>Based on his eponymous semi-autobiographical novel, <i>The Learning Tree</i> is Gordon Parks’ first major film effort and the first Black-directed movie for a major American studio. Alongside other classics like <i>Shaft</i>, Parks is recognized for his photojournalism career, in which he documented poverty, African American life, and civil rights issues. This film carries Parks’ photojournalist perspective, documenting his experience growing up in Kansas.</p>
