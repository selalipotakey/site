          <h2>It Happened One Night (1934)</h2>
          <h3>Frank Capra &middot; 105m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Winner of five Oscars—Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Adapted Screenplay—<i>It Happened One Night</i> is a triumph of pre-Code comedy and a key antecedent to the screwball form. Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable are both magnetic as a runaway heiress and a struggling reporter who bond over the course of a trip from Florida to New York City. The palpable chemistry of Colbert and Gable—romantic, sexual, and comedic—makes this a must-see.</p>

          <h3>Wu Jing &middot; 123m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>Wolf Warrior 2</i> is the ultimate spectacle of Chinese propaganda filmmaking; yet it remains an enigma in the American cultural zeitgeist, despite standing as the highest-grossing non-English language film of all time for nearly four years, raking in the equivalent of $874 million. It’s the story of heroic Chinese military involvement in an unnamed African nation, but it's also a look at what the Chinese military apparatus sees as its future in geopolitics.</p>

          <p>Maggie Cheung returns as longsuffering girlfriend May in the rip-roaring second installment of Jackie Chan’s vaunted <i>Police Story</i> series, this time getting roped into the action in a bigger way as part of a kidnapping plot that draws Chan’s Ka-kui back into the thick of things after the events of the first film saw him bumped down to highway patrol. <i>Police Story 2 </i>is an action showcase as rollicking as (if less glass-filled than) the first.</p>

          <h3>Akira Kurosawa &middot; 162m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>In his last epic film and final Shakespeare adaptation, Kurosawa imports "King Lear" to Sengoku-era Japan in the story of the aging warlord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) and the three sons set to inherit his kingdom. An extravagant production, <i>Ran</i> was the most expensive Japanese film ever made at the time, requiring a decade of planning during which Kurosawa hand-painted every shot of the film. <i>Ran</i> is a gorgeous masterpiece of betrayal and destruction.</p>

          <p>An extremely violent, graphic, and disturbing cult film that has recently gained in popularity, <i>Belladonna of Sadness</i> is a 1973 Japanese film by Eiichi Yamamoto. It follows Jeanne, a French peasant woman who is raped on her wedding night. In a series of Faustian pacts with a phallic devil, Jeanne simultaneously grows in power amongst the villagers and brings misery to those around her, all shown in psychedelically beautiful watercolor.</p>

          <p>Passengers riding a train from Seoul to Busan have their journey transformed into a fight for survival when an outbreak turns those infected into zombies. Faster than a speeding bullet (train), the epidemic rips through the coaches, with no relief in sight at already-infected stations. The only hope is reaching the end of the line in Busan, where a military quarantine awaits—but will the survivors reach it in time before the zombies reach them?</p>

As a biographical musical drama, it displays the complexities of Elvis' character and his relationships, as well as containing an all-star soundtrack contributed to by Doja Cat, Eminem and Stevie Nicks, among others.

          <h2>Céline and Julie Go Boating (1974)</h2>
          <h3>Jacques Rivette &middot; 193min &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>Rivette’s best-known film is an exuberant, freewheeling fantasy about the power of female camaraderie, the delights of narrative, and the fluid boundaries between life and art. After magician Céline (Juliet Berto) and librarian Julie (Dominique Labourier) meet, they move in together, swap identities, and time travel to a mansion with a gothic murder mystery. Co-written by the film's actresses, the film is one of Rivette's most enjoyable and enduring works.</p>
