          <h3>Delphine Seyrig &middot; 110m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>Be Pretty and Shut Up!</i> Delphine Seyrig turns the camera around to become the filmmaker, breaking the expectations and illusions placed on herself and others as she documents a series of interviews with well-known actresses like Juliet Berto, Jane Fonda, Shirley MacLaine, Anne Wiazemsky, and more. Seyrig asks questions that radically allow the women to speak for themselves, illuminating what it means to be a woman in the patriarchal film industry.</p>

          <p><i>Rabid</i> (1977) is an infectiously tantalizing offering which follows a young woman named Rose (Marilyn Chambers) after she is injured in a motorcycle accident and is forced to undergo an odd new procedure. After awaking from surgery, she finds she now has a phallic shaped growth and an overwhelming need to drink human blood. What begins with one person quickly spreads—offering a terrifying and eerily familiar picture of a world under siege by disease.</p>

          <p>The second documentary ever to win Venice's prestigious Golden Lion, <i>All the Beauty and the Bloodshed</i>  examines photographer-activist Nan Goldin's valiant effort to hold Purdue Pharma responsible for the opioid epidemic.
