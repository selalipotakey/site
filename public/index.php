Wade was overturned in 2022, seven Chicago women were arrested and charged with building an underground network to provide illegal abortions—each facing up to 110 years in prison. These were 'the Janes,' and this is their story.

          <h3>King Vidor &middot; 106m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Barbara Stanwyck earned her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress with this breathlessly melodramatic weepie about a brassy but affectionate mother who goes to heartbreaking extremes to build a better life for her beloved daughter. King Vidor's <i>Stella Dallas</i> is perhaps Stanwyck’s best classical acting showcase: a sizzle reel for her keen ability to bring a distinct naturalism to the heightened reality of Hollywood cinema at the time.</p>

          <h3>Julie Ha and Eugene Yi &middot; 83m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>We fight back! A pair of flashpoints for Asian American activism are portrayed in this double-feature: the first about the eviction of Filipino residents of the I-Hotel SRO, provoking one of history's most vigorous anti-gentrification organizing efforts; the second on the false imprisonment of Chol Soo Lee, which ignited a pan-Asian movement to free him. Both films see diverse communities drawn together in the shared experience of oppression.</p>

          <h3>Jean Renoir &middot; 114m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>It's no wonder Nazi regimes banned <i>The Grand Illusion</i>. Joseph Goebbels called it "Cinematic Public Enemy Number 1," while its themes center on World War I-era class differences and the demise of Western civilization. In the film, a motley group of prisoners must work together to escape the confines of a German prison camp. The beauty of eastern France and great actors like Erich von Stroheim playing the camp commander serve to enrich the tale.</p>

          <h3>Jayne Loader, Kevin Rafferty, and Pierce Rafferty &middot; 86m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A sardonic reflection on the threat of nuclear destruction, this 1982 film splices together dozens of mid-century informational shorts and army training videos for a wary American public living in the Reagan Era. Despite pulling from such disparate sources, directors Jayne Loader and the Rafferty brothers successfully reconstruct an overarching narrative of the anxiety, dark humor, and empty reassurances that proliferated during the Cold War.</p>

          <h3>John Wintergate &middot; 88m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>There’s normal 80s horror shlock, and then there’s <i>Boardinghouse</i>. Even its die-hard fans, like Cameron Worden of the Chicago Film Society, call it a “particularly crude labor of love.” Recognized as the first horror film shot on video but shown on film, Johnima and Kallassu Wintergate’s slasher film supplements the usual sex and gore with a healthy dose of telekinesis, a dash of new age sprituality, and a whole lot of the Wintergates’ band Lightstorm.</p>

          <h3>Martin Brest &middot; 157m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>An Oscar-winning remake of the 1974 Italian original, the 1992 <i>Scent of a Woman</i> stars Al Pacino as a blind, impossible-to-get-along-with former US army Lt. Col., and Chris O’Donnell as a struggling student who agrees to “babysit” Pacino’s character for purported “easy money.” Instead, over the course of a wild weekend in New York City, the rambunctious veteran teaches the mild-mannered student a thing or two about women, tango, and adulthood.</p>

          <h3>Saul Williams and Anisia Uzeyman &middot; 110m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A unique combination of science fiction, romance, and musical, <i>Neptune Frost</i> is the Afrofuturist tale of a hacker collective in Burundi. Led by escaped miners Neptune and Matalusa, the group schemes to rise up against the authoritarian regime that ceaselessly exploits the region and its inhabitants. Released to critical acclaim, <i>Neptune Frost</i> is a colorful, gripping story that is equal parts acerbic social critique and joyful ingenuity.</p>

          <h3>Mitchell Leisen &middot; 79m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>In some ways, <i>Death Takes a Holiday</i> presents a standard romantic dilemma for its protagonist: a choice between love and death. The only catch? Here, the protagonist <i>is</i> Death. Frederic March stars as the fated reaper, taking human form in an attempt to learn why it is that people fear him. During this three-day stint, he falls for the enchanting young Grazia (Evelyn Venable), and must choose whether to pursue his love or leave Grazia among the living.</p>
