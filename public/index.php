          <h3>Alfred Hitchcock &middot; 76m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>This loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s <i>The Secret Agent</i> is one of Hitchcock’s darkest films. Sylvia Sidney stars as a woman who is horrified to discover that her husband is a terrorist agent. <i>Sabotage</i> was not a box office hit and Hitch himself later felt that its famous “boy with the bomb” sequence was a mistake. However, its stature has grown over the years, and critics such as Pauline Kael have hailed it as the masterpiece of his British period.</p>

          <p>One of many collaborations between director Frank Capra and leading lady Barbara Stanwyck, <i>The Miracle Woman</i> follows Florence Fallon, a preacher’s daughter who becomes disillusioned with religion and stages phony miracles for a paying audience. Inspired by real-life evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, Sister Fallon is torn between her act and a chance at love.</p>

          <h3>Ang Lee &middot; 105m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>More than 30 years later, Ang Lee’s feature debut remains a testament to his skill as a director. The first in his "Father Knows Best" trilogy, <i>Pushing Hands</i> is centered on Mr. Chu—a Tai Chi master—who moves from Beijing to New York to stay with his son’s family. It's a warm and touching film, shaped by themes like clashing cultures and generational differences, which continue to appear in Lee’s later works.</p>

          <h3>Kathryn Bigelow &middot; 145m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>A Y2K cyberpunk thriller with Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, based on a James Cameron story, with music by PJ Harvey– <i>Strange Days</i> must have been a smash hit! As it turns out, audiences were unprepared for the scathing commentary on Clinton-era racism and misogyny, and the uncanny predictions on technology. Seen as a hidden gem of ‘90s sci-fi maximalism, <i>Strange Days</i> has earned a reevaluation as a socially conscious, forward-thinking take on the near-future dystopia.</p>

          <h3>Andy Milligan &middot; 84m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>A family of shitty kids and a miserable-ass mother get together for Christmas dinner. Drama ensues as secrets are revealed and soon a killer starts murdering the family members in gruesome ways. To some, this movie is just perverse and full of bad taste, reeking of a 42nd Street crowd's appetite, but beneath it there is a claustrophobic vision that may be of interest to enjoyers of such visceral experiences.</p>

          <p>Bart Tare, an ex-army man with a lifelong fixation on guns, meets Annie Starr, a sharpshooting carnival worker. The two strike up a hot-blooded romance centered around their shared fascination with firearms. When they find themselves broke and unemployed, Annie suggests they embark on a crime spree. An audacious and exhilarating film noir, <i>Gun Crazy</i> is a precursor to every lovers-on-the-run story that followed, including the ones of the French New Wave.</p>

          <h3>Sarah Maldoror &middot; 97m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Made near the end of the Angolan War of Independence, <i>Sambizanga</i> is a rallying cry against Portuguese colonialism. A period piece set in the early days of the thirteen-year conflict, Maria (Elisa Andrade) searches for her husband, who has been imprisoned for his dissidence against the regime. Creating a moving portrait of countless Angolan freedom fighters, director Sarah Maldoror casts a particular gaze towards the role of women in anti-colonial struggle.</p>
