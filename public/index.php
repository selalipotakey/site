Wade was overturned in 2022, seven Chicago women were arrested and charged with building an underground network to provide illegal abortions—each facing up to 110 years in prison. These were 'the Janes,' and this is their story.

          <h2>The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946)</h2>
          <h3>Lewis Milestone &middot; 116m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>When an unhappily married couple—played by Barbara Stanwyck and Kirk Douglas (in his first film!)—reunites with their childhood friend (Van Heflin) with whom they share a terrible secret, drama ensues, in <i>The Strange Love of Martha Ivers</i>. One of a string of darker antiheroine roles Stanwyck took on after the success of <i>Double Indemnity</i>, the film shows her comfort with morally ambiguous characters, which was unique among megastars at the time.</p>

          <p>Tonight, the personal and the political collide in a revolt against the dominant narrative; countermemories from victims of trauma are presented which refuse victimization. <i>Sa-I-Gu</i> portrays the Korean-American women who fought against the brutality of the police after the LA Uprising; <i>Bontoc Eulogy</i> mixes fact, fiction, and performance as the filmmaker interrogates the archival record of his grandfather's exploitation as a human exhibit.</p>

          <p>Tormented by alcoholism and uncontrollable rages, engineer Lantier (the eponymous "human beast") takes refuge in his skill and love for his train, which runs daily between Le Havre and Paris. When his assistant stationmaster commits murder, the man's wife turns to Lantier for comfort and even begs Lantier to kill her husband. Jean Gabin and Simone Simon star in a story based on Emile Zola's classic novel, a darkly tinged ancestor of film noir.</p>

          <h3>John Wintergate &middot; 88m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>There’s normal 80s horror shlock, and then there’s <i>Boardinghouse</i>. Even its die-hard fans, like Cameron Worden of the Chicago Film Society, call it a “particularly crude labor of love.” Recognized as the first horror film shot on video but shown on film, Johnima and Kallassu Wintergate’s slasher film supplements the usual sex and gore with a healthy dose of telekinesis, a dash of new age sprituality, and a whole lot of the Wintergates’ band Lightstorm.</p>

          <p>As fishing ships burst into flames across the Pacific, the Japanese government is horrified to find the culprit to be a prehistoric leviathan, awakened by hydrogen bomb tests in the Bikini Atoll. Both a timeless portrayal of national paranoia and a reimagination of the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, <i>Godzilla</i> stands the test of time as a condemnation of mankind’s ever-mounting destructive nature and the immortal debut of the King of the Monsters.</p>

          <h2>The Savages (2007)</h2>
          <h3>Tamara Jenkins &middot; 113m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>While critically acclaimed, <i>The Savages</i> is still one of this series’ most criminally-underwatched films. In it, playwright Wendy Savage (Laura Linney) and her brother Jon (Philip Seymour Hoffman) care for their estranged, senile father, all the while reckoning with the dysfunctional nature of their familial and personal lives. It is a harrowing depiction of a dreaded but largely universal experience—that of watching a parent age and ultimately die.</p>

          <p>The sequel to the 2018 Marvel blockbuster, <i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</i> sees a return to the Afrofuturist home of King T'Challa—the Black Panther—and his tribe. In the wake of T'Challa's death, his sister Shuri is given an ultimatum: Wakanda either relinquishes its vibranium detection technology, or puts itself in at risk of attack by aquatic superhumans. The nation must band together to defend itself, all while mourning their deceased king.</p>

The film features a largely improvised guitar score by Neil Young and gorgeous monochrome cinematography by the unparalleled Robby Müller.</p>
