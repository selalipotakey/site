          <h3>Howard Hawks &middot; 93m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>This wild ride of a gangster film portrays the rise and fall of a Chicago gangster (Paul Muni) modeled on Al Capone. Its gleeful blend of anarchic comedy and brutal violence outraged censors, who held up the release of the film for over a year. But Hawks’ singular vision inspired generations of filmmakers—including François Truffaut, who wrote, “[<i>Scarface</i>] isn’t literature. It may be dance or poetry. It is certainly cinema.”</p>

          <h3>John Huston &middot; 106m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>John Huston’s <i>Wise Blood</i> captures the absurd, grotesque, yet revelatory tenor of Flannery O’Connor’s acclaimed novel. Wild-eyed Hazel Motes (Brad Dourif) becomes a self-proclaimed prophet of the Church Without Christ: “where the blind don’t see and the lame don’t walk and what’s dead stays that way." Motes battles a rival street preacher (Harry Dean Stanton) for souls - including his own.</p>

          <p>Sisters Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet) grapple with financial hardship, societal expectations, and their different approaches to love. Thompson won the Academy Award for her screenplay, making her the only person to have won an Oscar for both screenwriting and acting. A tender and witty film,<i>Sense and Sensibility</i> demonstrates Ang Lee’s versatility as a director and is widely considered one of the best adaptations of an Austen work.</p>

          <p>Shot on 16mm and a low budget, <i>Basket Case</i> has become a cult classic horror movie. Duane Bradley goes around New York City carrying a mutant creature who can talk to him telepathically in a basket. Together, they are on a mission to get revenge on the doctor that did them wrong in the past. How are they related, and what wrong was done? <i>Basket Case</i> is a classic good time with cheap but surprisingly good gore effects and an atmosphere of grime.</p>

          <p>As lonely housewife Mabel becomes increasingly unhappy and unstable, her husband Nick, an L.A. construction worker, begins to think Mabel will be a danger to their children and himself, despite her love for them. Written by Cassavetes when Gena Rowlands desired a play about the difficulties faced by contemporary women, <i>A Woman Under the Influence</i> contains two of the most wrought and heart-breaking performances of a couple desperately in love but ostensibly incompatible.</p>
