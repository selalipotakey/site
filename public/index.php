          <h2>Ninotchka (1939)</h2>
          <h3>Ernst Lubitsch &middot; 110m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Greta Garbo shines as the titular Soviet envoy who is summoned to interbellum Paris to finalize the sale of jewelry confiscated in the Russian Revolution. While there, she must resist the charms of both capitalism and Melvyn Douglas, playing an aristocrat who is trying to retrieve the jewelry himself. Directed by Ernst Lubitsch from a script co-written by Billy Wilder, <i>Ninotchka</i> is a warm-hearted love story with a sharp satirical edge.</p>

          <h2>Dead Pigs (2018)</h2>
          <h3>Cathy Yan &middot; 130min &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>After last week’s screening, we need a little levity. Based on an actual incident involving 16,000 dead pigs, Cathy Yan’s (<i>Succession</i>, <i>Birds of Prey</i>) directorial debut is a kaleidoscopic tale of Shanghai in an era of breakneck development and increasing Western influence. Featuring a mix of Mandarin, English, and Shanghainese, <i>Dead Pigs</i> is a darkly hilarious social satire of humanity’s inability to find peace in an ever-changing world.</p>

          <h2>The Eagle Shooting Heroes (1993)</h2>
          <h3>Jeffrey Lau &middot; 103m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>Rumored to have been born, like <i>Chungking Express</i>, from the long editing process of Wong Kar-wai’s <i>Ashes of Time</i>, Jeffrey Lau’s <i>The Eagle Shooting Heroes</i> features a veritable all-star cast of Hong Kong’s finest—Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, and not one but both Tony Leungs, among others—clowning it up exquisitely. Featuring more slapstick, musical numbers, and wire-fu than you can shake a stick at, it is the gold standard for star-studded cash-grabs.</p>

          <h2>Forbidden Planet (1956)</h2>
          <h3>Fred M. Wilcox &middot; 98m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A hugely influential space opera that draws inspiration from "The Tempest," <i>Forbidden Planet</i> is a classic that lays claim to many sci-fi firsts. With its vivid Cinemascope color and all-electronic score, the film follows Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) and his starship as they travel to a distant planet to discover what happened to the members of a previous expedition, but find only one scientist, his daughter, and a robot—who warn them not to approach.</p>

          <h2>The Thief and the Cobbler: A Moment in Time (1992)</h2>
          <h3>Richard Williams &middot; 89m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Directed by Richard Williams, <i>The Thief and the Cobbler</i> is infamous for its nearly thirty year production cycle that left it incomplete. While grossly over budget and meeting critical and commercial failure upon release, the film would later become revered by critics and fans. Doc is proud to present the <i>A Moment in Time</i> Academy restoration, the closest to Williams' intended 1992 version, saved before the studios radically altered it for release.</p>
