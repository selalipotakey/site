Our PI Scottie’s in a real mess: obsessed with at least one woman and recovering from a bad case of—surprise, surprise—vertigo, he dives headfirst into a hallucinatory and macabre journey of possession, filled to the brim with intrigue and drop-dead gorgeous style.

Guillermo del Toro’s poignant tale, which employs masterful set and costume designs, will capture your heart and imagination in a way you never thought possible.

          <h2>Letters Home (1986)</h2>
          <h3>Chantal Akerman &middot; 104m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Known for the films about her relationship with her mother, Akerman’s third and last collaboration with Seyrig is fitting and poignant. Rarely seen, <i>Letters Home</i> is an adaptation of Rose Goldemberg's play, based on Sylvia Plath’s letters with her mother. Seyrig and her niece (Coralie Seyrig) recite the text directly to camera. Seyrig had asked Akerman to direct her in Racine's "Phèdre," but Akerman, not knowing Seyrig would die not long after, declined.</p>

          <h2>Y tu mamá también (2001)</h2>
          <h3>Alfonso Cuarón &middot; 106m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>Y tu mamá también</i>—an all-time classic—tells the tale of two horny Mexican teenagers, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael García Bernal), as they attempt to seduce an older Spanish woman by embarking on a road trip to a mythical and totally non-existent beach: the “Boca del Cielo.” Set against a backdrop of political upheaval and social change, Cuarón’s film explores sexuality, manhood, and youth in a way that has forever changed Mexican cinema.</p>

          <h3>David Cronenberg &middot; 98m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>Spider</i> follows the schizophrenic "Spider" (Ralph Fiennes) as he navigates his subconscious understanding of his own traumatic childhood. A deeply personal film for both Cronenberg and Fiennes, <i>Spider</i> finds itself at the cusp of the director's primary foci: disturbing body horror and the exploration of internal drama. Its generic ambiguity makes it one of Cronenberg's most overlooked films, despite being an incredible portrayal of past and present pain.</p>

          <h3>Albert Serra &middot; 162m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>This post-colonial fever dream of French Polynesia was voted best film of 2022 by <i>Cahiers du Cinéma</i> and "suggests John le Carré by way of David Lynch," per A.O. Scott. It's a slow-burning character study of High Commissioner De Roller (Benoît Magimel, <i>The Piano Teacher</i>), who floats through all walks of island life with an easy charisma. But the lush Tahitian setting pulses with a sense of dread that only grows as political alliances shift and unravel.</p>

          <h3>Cindy Sherman &middot; 95m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>As a photographer, Cindy Sherman is regarded for her conceptual self-portrait photography, which probes questions of identity, celebrity, and representation. Sherman made her feature film debut with <i>Office Killer</i>, a camp horror film about a copy editor (Carol Kane) who tumbles into a murderous rampage directed at her co-workers. At once comedy, horror, melodrama, noir, and feminist art piece, this film is sure to surprise, provoke, and tickle the senses.</p>
