          <h3>Ulrike Ottinger &middot; 165m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>An eclectic mix of women passengers on the Trans-Siberian railway—Lady Windermere (Seyrig), an American Broadway actor, a German teacher (Irm Hermann), and an adventurous girl—are taken captive by a hospitable Mongolian princess and experience Mongolia in all its beauty and power. Language and culture pose no boundaries in this colorful whirlwind of a film. One of Seyrig's four collaborations with director Ulrike Ottinger, and also her final film.</p>

It is preceded by Lyon's autobiographical short <i>Born to Film</i>, which mixes photographs from his father's archive with footage of himself and his son to create a tender tribute to Lyon's own life and family.</p>
