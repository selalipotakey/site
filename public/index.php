Wade was overturned in 2022, seven Chicago women were arrested and charged with building an underground network to provide illegal abortions—each facing up to 110 years in prison. These were 'the Janes,' and this is their story.

          <h3>Anatole Litvak &middot; 89m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>One of the bigger injustices of Oscars history is that Barbara Stanwyck never won a competitive Academy Award, with <i>Sorry, Wrong Number</i> netting her fourth and final Best Actress nomination. Playing a bedridden woman who is pulled into conspiracy after she overhears a murder plot over the telephone, Stanwyck (acting opposite fellow legend Burt Lancaster) mustered up every inch of Hollywood hysteria she could in this film noir curiosity.</p>

          <p>This screening begins with <i>Free Chol Soo Lee</i>, a film about the false imprisonment of Chol Soo Lee, which ignited a pan-Asian movement to free him. Rebelling against the model minority myth, <i>Forbidden City, U.S.A.</i> shows generations of Asian Americans clubbing instead of studying, and features delicious archival discoveries like performances by the "Chinese Frank Sinatra." <i>I Remember Dancing</i> adds to the sense of liberation, with images of gaysians erotically recounting their unrepressed sex, emphasizing the value in opposing stereotypes without privileging just masculinity or heterosexuality.</p>
          <p><i>Note: FREE CHOL SOO LEE has been added to this screening due to a previous cancellation.</i></p>

          <h3>Jean Renoir &middot; 99m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>In Renoir's first color film, five English sisters grow up beside the Ganges in the British colony of India. The eldest sister, Harriet, absorbs Hindu and Christian beliefs as she comes of age, and falls in love with a handsome English soldier. When her love is unrequited and an even worse tragedy strikes, she turns to the river to end her terrible despair. <i>The River</i> helped launch the career of Satyajit Ray, who was the assistant director of the film.</p>

          <h3>Sidney Lumet &middot; 112m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>When a critical system malfunction directs a group of nuclear-armed U.S. bombers to strike Moscow, the President scrambles to deflect them and prevent mutually assured destruction (sound familiar?). But whereas its twin film <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> played the nuclear threat as a dark political satire, <i>Fail Safe</i> gravely reminds us that even technical mistakes and political miscommunication cannot be treated lightly when Armageddon is but a button press away.</p>

          <p><i>The Master</i> follows traumatized Navy veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) after he returns from serving in WWII. One fateful night, he stows away on a passing yacht being used by Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the charismatic leader of “The Cause”. Dodd is immediately enamored with Quell, setting off a tempestuous relationship between the two. Phoenix and Hoffman's searing performances in this film are career-defining and unforgettable.</p>

Refusing to give up easily, Pádraic determinedly sets out to repair the situation with help from his sister Siobhán and the island delinquent, Dominic.

          <h3>Keisuke Kinoshita &middot; 98m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>The Ballad of Narayama</i> uses the art of kabuki theatre to explore the mythic practice of <i>obasute</i>—the abandonment of the elderly in a desolate place, where they are subsequently left to die. Kinuyo Tanaka plays Orin, a widow approaching 70, who accepts her fate graciously, unlike most of the village elderly. It is instead her son, Tatushei, who is reluctant to carry his aging mother up Narayama mountain.</p>
