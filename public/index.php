          <h3>Peter Bogdanovich &middot; 94min &middot; Digital*</h3>
          <p>Peter Bogdanovich borrowed the set-up of <i>Bringing Up Baby</i>— “daffy girl, square professor”—for this free-spirited comedy. Barbra Streisand runs wild across San Francisco as Judy Maxwell, an eccentric bohemian who takes a shine to musicologist Howard Bannister (Ryan O’Neale). If that’s not enough, throw in four identical bags containing various valuables, Madeline Kahn’s feature film debut, and a car chase to put <i>Bullitt</i> to shame.</p>

          <h3>Zhang Yimou &middot; 119min &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Zhang Yimou’s Oscar-nominated follow-up to 2002’s <i>Hero</i> is the spellbinding history of a doomed love-triangle set in the final years of the Tang Dynasty. Steeped in literary romantic tradition, while simultaneously paying homage to the legacy of wuxia filmmaking’s golden age, <i>House of Flying Daggers</i> is a staggeringly gorgeous work of martial arts crafted chaos that only the mind of Zhang Yimou, a true master of the medium, could create.</p>

          <h3>Olivier Assayas &middot; 99m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The first of Maggie Cheung’s two collaborations with filmmaker and erstwhile husband Olivier Assayas, <i>Irma Vep</i> burnished her bonafides as a global art-house icon. Playing a version of herself brought in to star in an increasingly troubled remake of the classic French serial <i>Les Vampires</i>, Cheung is the vessel through which Assayas is able to both discuss art’s complex relationship with commerce and depict its ability to nonetheless transcend the noise.</p>

          <h2>Chimes at Midnight (1966)</h2>
          <h3>Orson Welles &middot; 115m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Directed by and starring Orson Welles, <i>Chimes at Midnight</i> pulls liberally from the "Henry IV"s, "Richard II," "Henry V," and "The Merry Wives of Windsor" to spotlight the disreputable knight Sir John Falstaff and his relationship with Prince Hal, the rebellious son of King Henry IV. The film, Welles’ personal favorite, splices the Shakespearean source material to draw a profound, tragic underbelly out of the merry humor of its antihero.</p>

          <h2>La casa lobo (2018)</h2>
          <h3>Cristobal León & Joaquín Cociña &middot; 73m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Directed by Cristobal León and Joaquín Cociña, <i>La casa lobo</i> is a horror stop-motion animated film that follows María, who attempts to find refuge after leaving a religious fanatic cult. Eventually, she finds a home inhabited by two pigs, but the longer María stays in the house, the more unsettling it becomes. Though this film uses fairy-tale-like imagery at times, the film is inspired by the real Colonia Dignidad, a post-WWII German cult in Chile.</p>

          <h3>Yorgos Lanthimos &middot; 97m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Unequivocally disturbing to the nth degree, <i>Dogtooth</i> is quarantined homeschooling from hell. Three teenagers, a son and two daughters, are raised wholly in a compound, knowing of the outside world only the dangers of man-eating cats and the possible existence of another brother. To quell the son's sexual frustrations, the father hires a woman to come to the home, but this outsider soon threatens to undo the perverted world the kids' parents have created.</p>

          <h3>David Leitch &middot; 126m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A good, old-fashioned star vehicle for Brad Pitt and a motley assortment of beloved cinema himbos, <i>Bullet Train</i> crams together yakuza gangs, international hitmen, and a rogue Channing Tatum cameo onto a high-speed imagination of the Tokaido Shinkansen. David Leitch of <i>John Wick</i> fame directs as Pitt’s reformed bagman finds a simple grab-and-go job going horribly off the rails. If anything, this film dares to ask: How much is <i>too</i> much movie?</p>

          <h2>The Gang of Four (1989)</h2>
          <h3>Jacques Rivette &middot; 160min &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Four young women are sharing a home and studying at a drama school run by a notoriously demanding grande dame. As they rehearse a play, one of the group mysteriously disappears, an enigmatic stranger arrives on the scene, and the lines between theater and “real life” become increasingly blurred. Gorgeously lensed by the great Caroline Champetier, <i>Gang of Four</i> is an engrossing exploration of Rivette’s classic themes and one of his most thoughtful works.</p>
