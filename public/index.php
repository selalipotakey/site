                  <p class="capsule fittext">This loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s <i>The Secret Agent</i> is one of Hitchcock’s darkest films. Sylvia Sidney stars as a woman who is horrified to discover that her husband is a terrorist agent. <i>Sabotage</i> was not a box office hit and Hitch himself later felt that its famous “boy with the bomb” sequence was a mistake. However, its stature has grown over the years, and critics such as Pauline Kael have hailed it as the masterpiece of his British period.</p>

She is tasked with seducing and killing Mr. Yee (Tony Leung), a high-ranking official, but as the assassination plot advances, Chia Chi’s loyalty to the resistance—and her feelings for Mr. Yee—become increasingly complicated.</p>

          <h3>Marcel Carné &middot; 93m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A factory worker (Jean Gabin) kills a man, then holes himself up in his apartment. As he awaits the police, he thinks back on the events that turned him into a murderer. Scripted by the poet Jaques Prévert, this melancholy masterpiece of poetic realism is distinguished by its gorgeously atmospheric filmmaking and Gabin’s utterly iconic performance. Its aura of fatalistic despair parallels the mood of France on the brink of world war.</p>

          <h3>Oscar Micheaux &middot; 102m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>27-year-old Paul Robeson made his acting debut in Oscar Micheaux’s <i>Body and Soul</i> playing the roles of identical twins - one honest but poor, the other a crooked preacher - who are in love with the same woman. Micheaux was forced to cut “immoral” and “sacrilegious” scenes; while the director’s cut has never been recovered, <i>Body and Soul</i> is one of Micheaux’s few surviving silent films.</p>

          <h3>Ang Lee &middot; 127m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Ang Lee’s <i>Life of Pi</i>, based on Yann Martel’s novel of the same name, is perhaps his most gorgeous film. Deeply thought-provoking and emotionally rich, it depicts the adventure of a boy nicknamed Pi stranded in the middle of the ocean…with a Bengal tiger. The film's breathtaking visuals and philosophical narrative earned it critical acclaim and several Academy Awards, including Best Director. Come for the tiger, stay for a hopeful, beautiful experience.</p>

          <h3>Gaspar Noé &middot; 97m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Inverting the rape-revenge genre, <i>Irréversible</i> combines dizzying camerawork and a stomach-churning score by Daft Punk’s Thomas Bangalter. Infamously unwatchable, it dwells on the most base forms of hatred and disgust and makes us reckon with humanity’s id in the face of modernity. Noé’s tapestry of two men (Vincent Cassel, Albert Dupontel) avenging their lover (Monica Bellucci) is canonized and shunned for its onslaught of cruelty towards the viewer.</p>

          <p>In this sexploitation film, Carla is sick of life with her aunt who berates her for her relationships with men. After being introduced by a tarot card reader to a cult that worships Pan, Carla uses the erotic power of roses to make her Aunt and cousin sex-crazed. Soon, though, she starts to see the cult as a more sinister force… This movie is soaked in the atmosphere of a noir but incorporates hints of fantasy and other genres to create something unique.</p>

          <p>In a dead-end South Dakota town, Holly, a lonely teenage girl, meets Kit, a handsome 20-something garbage collector. Kit’s charming nature belies underlying violent tendencies that Holly is unaware of. When Holly’s father disapproves of their relationship, Kit murders him and the two escape to the badlands of Montana. Based on the real Starkweather killing spree, <i>Badlands</i> is a poetic juxtaposition of innocence, natural beauty, and human violence.</p>

Combining European arthouse visuals with Latin American modernity, these films were hotbeds of controversy in their day and now serve as towering works capturing the zeitgeist of their time.</p>
