          <h2>Bringing Up Baby (1938)</h2>
          <h3>Howard Hawks &middot; 102min &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Directed by Howard Hawks with performances from Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, <i>Bringing Up Baby</i> unites three screwball icons for a wacky, romantic romp through the Northeast. Meek palaeontologist David Huxley encounters the charmingly chaotic Susan Vance and is pulled into a weekend of wild adventure featuring a disobedient dog, a precious dinosaur bone, and a pet leopard. A true romp in the best sense, <i>Baby</i> is an undeniable screwball classic.</p>

          <h3>Lu Chuan &middot; 133m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Both a maximalist war epic and a harrowing look at the effects of genocide and mass violence, <i>City of Life and Death</i> recounts the Nanking Massacre with a stark realism that refuses to pull any punches. Shot in crisp black and white, the film evokes the horrific images of war-torn China seared into the world’s collective consciousness. It is a beautiful tapestry and shocking testament to the unlimited cruelty men are capable of inflicting upon others.</p>

          <h2>Center Stage (1991)</h2>
          <h3>Stanley Kwan &middot; 126m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>Center Stage</i> is a biopic on the tragically short life of 1930s screen legend Ruan Lingyu that doubles as a meta meditation on film and celebrity, both back then and now. Director Stanley Kwan weaves past and present together in a time-jumping tapestry that embodies Chinese cinema's remembrance of itself, tied together by Cheung in one of her very best performances—or at the very least, in one that demanded the largest number of her gifts. </p>

          <h3>Gus Van Sant &middot; 102m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>This iconic film of New Queer Cinema takes the Henriad on the road, with River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves as a floating pair of young hustlers. Phoenix plays a wistful narcoleptic, Mike Waters, searching for his mother; Reeves accompanies him as Scott Favor, the wealthy son of Portland’s mayor, killing time on the streets until his inheritance kicks in. A dreamlike jewel of unrequited love, tenderness, and a distinctly queer longing for home.</p>

The main story follows Fehérlófia, meaning "Son of the White Mare," who is the youngest son of a magical horse. As he grows older and gains powers from his mother, he listens to her ancient tales of dragons prophesied to destroy his world. With the help of his brothers, Fehérlófia sets out to slay the dragons.</p>

          <p>Is this the only Iranian feminist skateboard revenge vampire suburban Expressionist Western out there? Even if it’s not, it’s certainly the best. Ana Lily Amirpour's œuvre chronicles the interactions of a series of characters in the fictional Bad City including drug dealers, junkies, partiers, and a mysterious vampiric woman. With gorgeous black and white cinematography and elegant direction, this is a film that demands to be seen on the big screen.</p>

          <h3>Joseph Kosinski &middot; 130m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A feature-length Navy recruitment ad that also doubles as one of the best movies of the year, <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i> is Tom Cruise saving the box office like he said he would. Cruise returns as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, now confronting mortality as he trains a new crop of cocky fighter pilots to carry out a mission against a conspicuously unnamed enemy. The result is a marriage of cinema and propaganda so glorious, Zhang Yimou probably shed a tear.</p>

          <h2>Duelle (1976)</h2>
          <h3>Jacques Rivette &middot; 121m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>In the shadowy demimonde of contemporary Paris, the Sun and Moon Goddesses do battle over a magic diamond that will allow the winner to remain on Earth. At the time of its release, this ravishing, daringly experimental, noir-stained fantasy divided critics. But it has since come to be regarded as one of Rivette's most striking and inventive films. It was part of a projected tetralogy of which only one other episode (1976’s <i>Noroît</i>) was ever completed.</p>
