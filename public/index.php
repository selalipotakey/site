          <h3>Howard Hawks &middot; 92min &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Possibly <i>the</i> definitive screwball comedy, <i>His Girl Friday</i> stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as newspaper editor Walter Burns and his star reporter Hildy Johnson…who also happen to be ex-spouses. When Hildy decides to remarry and quit the paper, Walter convinces her to cover one last story, even as he tries to win her back. With pitch-perfect performances from everyone involved, this movie is more than a laugh-a-minute—it’s a laugh-a-line.</p>

          <h3>Yung Chang &middot; 93m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>A quietly angry depiction of rural China’s shift towards a tourism-based consumer economy, <i>Up the Yangtze</i> serves as a stark reminder of North American complicity in the struggle of everyday Chinese citizens. Centered around a riverboat cruise ship catered towards English-speaking tourists, Yung Chang’s 2007 feature debut maintains a melancholic optimism for the lives of two ordinary people coming to terms with their place in a new China.</p>

          <p>As much a dark reprise as it is a sequel to <i>The Heroic Trio, Executioners</i> finds our protagonists now navigating a post-apocalyptic city suffering from nuclear fallout and a scarce, dictator-controlled water supply. Zagging towards steampunk where the first film zigged towards Marvel, Johnnie To’s follow-up is a heavier affair that nonetheless features copious amounts of fisticuffs and Maggie Cheung-thrown grenades--how could you not be entertained?</p>

          <p>A homoerotic merger of Lynch's <i>Eraserhead</i> and the kaiju genre, director Shinya Tsukamoto's first feature is the epitome of cyberpunk body horror. <i>Tetsuo: The Iron Man</i> follows the "Salaryman" as he is thrust into a carnal, industrial nightmare, slowly turning into a metallic monster after being cursed by the "Metal Fetishist" he accidentally hits with his car. Grimy, grotesque, and grossly phallic, this is the film masochist's cult classic must-see.</p>

          <h3>Jacques Rivette &middot; 177min &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Part two of Rivette’s epic chronicles Joan’s imprisonment and interrogation by the British, but notably omits her trial, which features prominently in other cinematic accounts of her life. As in part one, Rivette’s focus on quotidian details and the spaces between the great events of Joan's life humanizes her in ways that are profoundly moving. Rivette’s long takes and the beauty and austerity of his images illuminate the saint’s inner and outer lives..</p>
