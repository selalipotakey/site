                    <p class="capsule fittext">Nearly 50 years before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, seven Chicago women were arrested and charged with building an underground network to provide illegal abortions—each facing up to 110 years in prison. These were 'the Janes,' and this is their story.

          <p>Loni Ding, founder of what is now known as the Center for Asian American Media (CAAM), is a critical figure in Asian American media history. <i>Ancestors in the Americas</i>, her final film, is an epic of revisionist history that blends fiction and non-fiction. 35 years after its founding, CAAM shows its commitment to countermemory with <i>The Chinese Exclusion Act</i>, a portrait of the seldom-remembered Chinese Americans who redefined what it means to be American.</p>

          <h3>Jean Renoir &middot; 96m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Maurice, played by the great Michel Simon, is the ever-so-naive clerk who aspires to be a painter, despite the nagging of his abusive wife. One night he rescues the seemingly-innocent Lulu from a beating and quickly falls for her; he even rents an apartment for her. But when Maurice's wife threatens to trash his paintings, Lulu and her pimp scheme to steal and sell them for a fortune. This dark drama is Renoir's first full-length sound feature.</p>

          <h3>Isao Takahata &middot; 89m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Directed by Studio Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata, <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> stands as the studio’s darkest film with its heartwrenching depiction of codependence, loss and near-helplessness in the midst of war. Following a pair of siblings, Seita and Setsuko, in their struggle to survive the final months of WWII after losing their parents in the Kobe bombings, the film ruthlessly showcases how global conflict has evolved to tear down even civilians.</p>

          <h3>Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez &middot; 81m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>In October of 1994, three student filmmakers set out to make a documentary about a local legend, but find something far more sinister in the Black Hills of Maryland. Nearly a decade before the box office success of <i>Paranormal Activity</i> (2007) and <i>Cloverfield</i> (2008), <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> defined found footage horror. Blending video and 16mm footage, writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez create a deeply tense and realistic atmosphere.</p>

          <h3>Charlie Kaufman &middot; 123m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>Synecdoche, New York</i> follows Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an ailing theater director, as he leaves his bleak life in Schenectady, New York to create a mind-bending theater production that seeks to mirror all life in New York City—by literally recreating the city inside a massive warehouse. A film Roger Ebert called the best of the decade, <i>Synecdoche, New York</i> demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate its sheer complexity and surrealism.</p>

          <h3>Olivia Wilde &middot; 123m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Olivia Wilde’s follow-up to her hit directorial debut <i>Booksmart</i> may be best known for its backstage disputes (did Harry Styles spit on Chris Pine?), but don’t you want to see the drama that led to all that drama? In it, a couple moves to an idyllic company town that harbors a horrific secret. Wilde framed her 1950s dystopia as pushback against modern-day incels, and critics praised her performance in the film, as well as Florence Pugh’s and Chris Pine’s.</p>

          <p>When aging bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is diagnosed with stomach cancer, he is forced to come to terms with the true trajectory of his life so far—that after 30 years at Tokyo City Hall, he hasn't accomplished a thing. While bleak in subject matter, <i>Ikiru</i> shows Kurosawa at his most sensitive and compassionate, following Mr. Watanabe as, in the face of looming death, he finds the courage to do what he hasn't done before: live (<i>ikiru</i>).</p>
