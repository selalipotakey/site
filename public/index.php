                    <p class="capsule fittext">Nearly 50 years before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, seven Chicago women were arrested and charged with building an underground network to provide illegal abortions—each facing up to 110 years in prison. These were 'the Janes,' and this is their story.

          <h3>Frank Capra &middot; 99m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>It’s difficult to believe that Barbara Stanwyck was only 23 when she starred in <i>Ladies of Leisure</i>, as she brings a worldly assuredness to Kay, a gold-digging party girl who enters a relationship of convenience with an artistic scion (Lowell Sherman) that soon turns into something more. A risqué pre-Code outing with heart to spare, the mature romance was the first of five creative collaborations between Stanwyck and the great Frank Capra.</p>

          <p>These videos adopt poststructuralist doubts about objective truth, but end up with divergent results. <i>History and Memory</i> layers materials from both found and reconstructed sources to examine Japanese internment and its aftermath on a family. <i>Fresh Kill</i> is a bewilderingly fun "eco cyber noia": there's a South Asian lesbian who lives in garbage, a Chinese hacker and chef who serves radioactive sushi, and a Black "satellite dishwasher" raving about birds.</p>

          <h2>Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932)</h2>
          <h3>Jean Renoir &middot; 85m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Michel Simon is gloriously anti-social, dirty, charming, and undomesticated as Boudu, the tramp whom the bookseller Lestingois rescues from drowning. When he brings Boudu home and tries to civilize him, the wild man instead lusts after Mrs. Lestingois and the maid, and otherwise brings chaos into this middle-class household. It's a rich satire that contrasts Boudu's instinctive anarchism with French bourgeois values—oh, and it's funny, too.</p>

          <p>Set during the immediate years after August 6th, 1945, <i>Hiroshima</i> portrays a classroom in their attempt to return to normalcy after the atom bomb destroyed their city, ravaged not just by radiation poisoning but also reckless gambling and discrimination against scarred victims. Featuring hundreds of Hiroshima survivors within its cast, the film portrays a dramatic yet accurate recreation of one of the 20th century’s most infamous tragedies.</p>

          <h3>Spike Lee &middot; 135m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>In Spike Lee’s fierce satire of mass media, Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans), an Ivy-educated network television writer, creates a modern-day minstrel show complete with African American actors donning blackface. Though commercially unsuccessful upon its release, <i>Bamboozled</i> has become a cult favorite within the director’s oeuvre, with critic Ashley Clark calling it “the central film in Lee’s canon—the house on fire to which all roads lead.”</p>

          <h3>Paul Thomas Anderson &middot; 183m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>PTA’s <i>Magnolia</i> is a varied tapestry of interwoven stories, each following a different resident of Los Angeles’s San Fernando Valley, and slowly coming together as the story unfolds. A marathon of unearthed secrets, family drama, and unrequited desire—with a final twist that feels almost like divine intervention—this is a film that shines through both the stellar performances of its ensemble cast and the tense relationships that Anderson constructs.</p>

          <h3>Park Chan-wook &middot; 138m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Park Chan-wook won Best Director at Cannes for this haunting noir about a policeman (Park Hae-il) who falls for a murder suspect (Tang Wei). Park strips away the baroque style he became known for in films like <i>Oldboy</i> and <i>The Handmaiden</i>, stating he wanted to subvert modern tropes of the detective as either excessively violent or brilliant. The love story here was inspired by the Korean song “Mist,” which is woven throughout the film’s gorgeous score.</p>

          <h3>Ingmar Bergman &middot; 96m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Having just returned to plague-ridden Sweden after fighting in the Crusades, medieval knight Antonius Block is met suddenly by Death, whom he challenges to a chess match over his very soul. Bergman is uncompromising, placing the silence of God at the very heart of his film; but he weaves glints of human kindness into this macabre tapestry, as Block and his squire Jöns try to accomplish one redemptive act before joining for eternity in the Dance of Death.</p>
