These were 'the Janes,' and this is their story.

          <h3>Douglas Sirk &middot; 80m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>The first of two collaborations between Barbara Stanwyck and the master of the domestic melodrama, Douglas Sirk himself, <i>All I Desire</i> is a crackerjack portrait of the simultaneous contentment and claustrophobia of American suburbia. Playing a mother who returns to the family she abandoned a decade earlier, Stanwyck brings her trademark world-weary maturity to the already-complex Sirkian woman in a perfect movie marriage of auteur and star.</p>

          <p>In 1968, the Third World Liberation Front demanded the decolonizing of academia, leading a group of Asian American artists to form the media collective and nonprofit Visual Communications. VC worked in a mode of anticapitalist community cinema, sharing collectivized authorship with their subjects. Tonight's films exemplify VC's unassuming yet passionate style, from the struggles of early immigrants to the polycultural fusion embraced by newer generations.</p>

          <p>Impoverished Polish princess Elena (Ingrid Bergman) has numerous men pining after her: among others, the famous General Rollan (Jean Marais), although she loves another man, the Count of Chevincourt (Mel Ferrer), who's also the General's aide. Her love life will alter the future of France in this romantic film that led Truffaut to say "sex is the only focus of attention." Was he talking about the uniquely sensuous beauty of Ingrid Bergman? Perhaps.</p>

          <p>Based on Raymond Briggs' Cold War-era graphic novel, <i>When the Wind Blows</i> is a hand-drawn tale about an elderly couple whose life in the English countryside is disrupted by impending nuclear attacks. With their Blitz-era survival strategies, faith in government, and love for each other, the pair are convinced they can prepare for the worst—until an ICBM mercilessly tears their worldview down.

          <p>Snorting wasabi, joyriding in golf carts, and playing with live alligators are just some of the hellish delights on display in this prank show on a Hollywood budget. After three glorious seasons on MTV, Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Wee Man, and the gang roared into theaters and started a surprisingly durable comedy franchise. <i>Village Voice</i> critic Ed Halter called <i>Jackass: The Movie</i> “ruthlessly efficient: no plot, no characters, no sets, and no downtime.”</p>

          <p>The first studio film to incorporate the 9/11 attacks into its narrative, Spike Lee’s <i>25th Hour</i> matches the funereal, somber tone in NYC at that time. The film follows former drug dealer Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) as he reevaluates his life in the 24 remaining hours before his 7-year prison sentence, spending time with his closest friends (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper) and preparing his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) for his lengthy absence.</p>

Critiques of self-indulgence aside, <i>Bardo</i> is a show of Iñárritu's visual mastery, featuring his trademark sweeping shots and long takes that ought to be watched on the big screen.</p>

          <h3>Juraj Herz &middot; 95m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Juraj Herz's deeply unsettling second film follows Karel Kopfrkingl (Rudolf Hrušínský), a crematorium worker in Prague who descends into madness while Europe is launched into World War II. Before the war, Karel takes pride in his work, citing Tibetan Buddhist ideas to justify his 'liberation' of the dead. Brilliantly creepy camerawork accentuates Karel's evil mania when the Nazis recruit him to 'liberate' more souls—even those the very closest to him.</p>
