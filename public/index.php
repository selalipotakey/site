          <h3>Joel Coen & Ethan Coen &middot; 100min &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>The Coen Brothers’ <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i> is one of the purest (and funniest) screwballs of the modern age. Elite divorce attorney Miles Massey (George Clooney) and serial divorcée Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones) match wits in this loopy, fast-paced tale of love and deception. With Roger Deakins' elegant cinematography and an endlessly hummable Carter Burwell score, <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i> stands out even amid the Coens’ remarkable filmography.</p>

          <p>Jia Zhangke’s first film to take home Venice’s Golden Lion is the diptych narrative of two strangers in search of their respective partners set against the background of the destruction of Yangtze River communities brought on by the Three Gorges Dam. Featuring Jia's cousin Han Sanming playing a fictionalized version of himself working as a coal miner in Shanxi, <i>Still Life</i> toes the line between a documentary and a social-realist drama.</p>

          <h3>Peter Chan &middot; 118m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Criminally underseen in the West, <i>Comrades</i> is a trenchant and affecting document of Chinese diaspora disguised as a sweet romantic dramedy. Starkly different from her more iconic roles because of how conventional it is, Maggie Cheung here plays a snarky and street-smart city girl opposite Leon Lai’s dopey transplant as they navigate both a changing Hong Kong and their burgeoning feelings for each other, all set to the dulcet tones of Teresa Teng.</p>

          <h3>Tom Stoppard &middot; 117m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>An absurdist riff on "Hamlet" that focuses on his childhood friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, played by Gary Oldman and Tim Roth respectively. In Shakespeare’s version, the two are conniving but ineffectual spies for Hamlet’s uncle Claudius. In this adaptation, they bumble in and out of the action of "Hamlet," mixing up their own names, flipping coins, digressing on the nature of theatre, being generally confused, and, of course, dying.</p>

Neglected by her parents, she struggles to adjust to her new surroundings until she finds an alternate world that, though perfect, is not all it seems.

          <h3>Tobe Hooper &middot; 96m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>A criminally underrated piece of horror from the master of slashers, Tobe Hooper, <i>The Funhouse</i> is the quintessential 1980s teen slasher flick. When four Iowa teens take a trip to a rundown travelling carnival, they never expected to meet their end at the hands of a grusome serial killer. What begins as a night of pot-smoking, strip-teasing, and general crass '80s humor takes a turn for the worse when the true nature of the funhouse is revealed...</p>

          <p>Despite the English-language title taking its name from the play by Eugene O’Neill, <i>Long Day’s Journey Into Night</i> is a work wholly its own. A dreamy vision of nocturnal Kaili, Bi Gan’s 2018 feature follows the wayward Luo in search of an elusive former lover.

          <h3>Jacques Rivette &middot; 238min &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Rivette’s biggest box office hit and the most acclaimed film of his later career was this mesmerizing drama of artistic obsession. It stars an aging painter, his reluctant muse, and their struggle to finish a long-abandoned portrait. Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, “rarely has Rivette’s use of duration to look at process been as spellbinding as it is here . . . Rivette’s superb sense of rhythm and mise en scene never falters, and the plot has plenty of twists.”</p>
