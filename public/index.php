                    <p class="capsule fittext">Taking place on a single day of a happening Los Angeles car wash, Michael Schultz’s film is the perfect summer comedy encapsulating the zeitgeist of a rapidly changing American landscape. With an all-star lineup that includes Richard Pryor, Bill Duke, George Carlin, the Pointer Sisters, and Franklyn Ajaye, _Car Wash_ is a hilariously biting flick with an ineffable joie de vivre, and also a major milestone in ‘70s Black studio filmmaking.

He has succeeded.” “This is not a sequel– there has NEVER been anything like it!” “The world is full of them, the super-octane girls who are old at twenty… if they get to be twenty.” “This time… they’ve really gone <i>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</i>.”

Equal parts American genre film and European arthouse, <i>Point Blank</i> contains the nihilism of a man who has lost himself in the face of constant double-crossing and is plagued by the remnants of the Second World War. With stellar photography by Philip Lathrop, John Boorman’s major breakthrough is today an enshrined classic that helped to usher in the new age of hard-boiled American crime cinema.

          <h2>Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969)</h2>
          <h3>Paul Mazursky &middot; 105m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>It's ‘69, and the sexual mores of the mid-century have been smashed open. X-rated films were winning Best Picture, hippies camped out at a dairy farm upstate, gays were smashing windows, and a little dramedy about an orgy won over audiences across America. Featuring a killer score by Quincy Jones, multiple unshaved chests, and an Oscar-nominated screenplay, Paul Mazursky’s _Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice_ was the little husband and wife-swapping film that could. Bob and Carol, liberated by a New Age retreat, plan a hookup with their more traditional pals, Ted and Alice, in this work of lasciviousness and surprising emotional honesty.</p>

          <h2>The Long Goodbye (1973)</h2>
          <h3>Robert Altman &middot; 112m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>The Long Goodbye</i> starts not with a bang, but with a vibe. Elliott Gould’s Philip Marlowe wanders through a 1973 L.A. laden with denizens who have little between their ears. In typical Robert Altman style, he sends Marlowe into a rabbit-hole of dead friends and strangers. Suspicion falls on Marlowe after an old friend’s wife is found dead, but this quickly becomes the least of his worries. Gangsters, alcoholic writers, and detox clinics all join Altman’s cavalcade symphony of Malibu vapidity.</p>
