          <h3>E.A. Dupont &middot; 109m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Though she began her career in Hollywood, the groundbreaking Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong found her greatest roles abroad. In <i>Piccadilly</i>, she gives a mesmerizing performance as a dancer whose involvement in an interracial romance becomes her undoing. Made in England and helmed by German expressionist master E.A. Dupont, Piccadilly boasts dazzling camera work, spectacular sets and costumes, and a pervasive atmosphere of erotic doom.</p>

          <p>Robert Duvall wrote, directed, financed, and starred in <i>The Apostle</i>, a humanistic portrait of a Pentecostal preacher named Sonny who goes on the run after killing his wife’s lover. Re-christening himself, Sonny lands in a small Louisiana town and begins preaching on a local radio station. Without cynicism, <i>The Apostle</i> captures the rhythm, artistry, and humanity of charismatic preaching.</p>

          <p>Visually ambitious and incredibly dynamic, <i>Hulk</i> is unlike any other superhero film, bursting with bold creativity and technical innovation. It explores the origins of Hulk—the green-skinned monster that Dr. Bruce Banner transforms into after an experiment gone wrong—and is noteworthy for its portrayal of the character’s emotional aspects. Ang Lee’s <i>Hulk</i> is a must-see for those wanting both thrilling action and a nuanced depiction of Bruce Banner.</p>

          <h3>Pablo Larraín &middot; 107m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>We all need a little more experimental reggaetón in our lives. <i>Ema</i> captures the raw emotion of a bitter divorce and filters it through electrifying dance performances and an unhealthy dose of pyromania. Surreal and excruciatingly accurate, Pablo Larraín’s visually sumptuous return to Chilean cinema is led by the dynamism of Gael García Bernal and Mariana Di Girolamo—accompanied by an equally expressive score by fellow countryman Nicolás Jaar.</p>

          <p>One of the most nihilistic anti-war movies to exist. A Vietnam vet returns home to New York, where his inability to get a job, grimy lifestyle, and lasting PTSD plunge him further and further into losing grip on his sanity until the shocking end. Everything in this movie feels bleak and like the world is crumbling. <i>Combat Shock</i> marks the beginning of Buddy Giovinazzo’s career as a director and stars his brother Rick in the leading role.</p>

          <p>In this operatic tragedy, Mitch, a geologist, begins working for his best friend’s debased Texas oil family. However, when he falls in love with his friend’s unsatisfied wife, Lucy (Lauren Bacall), their affair unleashes a torrent of psychosexual angst, jealousy, and a murder accusation by the family’s debaucherous daughter Marylee. In this feverish melodrama, Douglass Sirk crafts some of his most florid technicolor visuals and most scathing critiques of American culture.</p>

Set during the American Civil War, it follows friends Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) who join the Irregulars, a guerilla warfare unit fighting for the Confederacy.

          <p>When the sociologist Miguel arrives in rural Peru, he quickly becomes entranced by the folkloric traditions of the land, as well as Nexy, a mysterious local haunted by her past. What follows is a hallucinatory dream of a film as Nexy disappears and Miguel attempts to use the psychedelic to learn about his lost companion. A visually arresting debut and the first Peruvian feature directed by a woman, this tropical romance exudes an energy entirely its own.</p>
