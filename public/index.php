          <h3>Fritz Lang &middot; 86m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Reformed ex-convict Eddie Taylor (Henry Fonda) can’t catch a break; when he’s framed for murder, he goes on the lam with his lawyer’s sympathetic secretary (Sylvia Sidney). Fritz Lang’s haunting, socially conscious melodrama has been called his best American film. Critic Dave Kehr noted that Lang’s style here had a huge influence on film noir: “it’s always night, usually raining, and the camera hovers over the characters like the heavy hand of fate.”</p>

          <p>Adapted from the play by Tennessee Williams, John Huston’s <i>The Night of the Iguana</i> follows the social and psychological decline of T. Lawrence Shannon (Richard Burton), a defrocked minister who now drives a tour bus in Puerto Vallarta. Shannon attempts to strand a bus of Baptist school teachers at a remote motel, where he sorts out his life with the help of two women (Ava Gardner and Deborah Kerr).</p>

          <h3>Ang Lee &middot; 138m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>Ang Lee’s (non-typical) take on the Western! Set during the American Civil War, it follows friends Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) who join the Irregulars, a guerilla warfare unit fighting for the Confederacy. Notable for its exploration of unconventional narratives, an intimate, character-driven story, and Frederick Elmes’ beautiful cinematography,<i>Ride with the Devil</i>is one of Lee’s most interesting films.</p>

          <p>Weren’t satisfied by our last Y2K spectacular? Well, here’s <i>Millennium Mambo</i>, the more melancholy take on the new millennium and one of Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s finest works. In the spirit of films like Wong Kar-Wai’s <i>Love Trilogy</i>, <i>Millennium Mambo</i> captures the ennui of youth and lost time as it charts Vicky’s (Shu Qi) bygone time on the dance floor in a rapidly changing Taipei.</p>

          <h3>Doris Wishman &middot; 65m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Doris Wishman’s 1965 sexploitation film pushes the genre into something much more horrifying (and perhaps honest). A woman kills the person who sexually assaulted her and goes on the run in New York City, but the city proves to be a layer of hell as she is abused again and again. With a unique editing style and a jazz score, Wishman creates an interesting, almost surreal atmosphere. Definitely a heavy watch.</p>

          <h3>Liliana Cavani &middot; 118m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>On a trip to Vienna with her husband, Lucia, a Holocaust survivor, encounters Max—a former SS officer, and her former torturer and lover. Reunited, the two recreate their sadomasochistic relationship; however, Max’s former SS comrades start to stalk them. Unsettling and controversial, <i>The Night Porter</i> intertwines the grief of the victim and the guilt and shame of the offender into an unflinching tale about remembering the atrocities of the Holocaust.</p>

        <h3>Nabwana Isaac Godfrey Geoffrey &middot; 68m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>From the Ugandan slum studio Wakaliwood of cult <i>Who Killed Captain Alex?</i> fame comes this gonzo action-comedy. After Bad Black (Nalwanga Gloria), the biggest mafiosa in Uganda’s capital city, steals from an American doctor, he must team up with Kung fu kid Wesley Snipes (Rolean Kasule) to take back his family heirloom. Bear witness to the dizzying action and witty script born of a self-taught MacGyver director and a whopping $65 budget.</p>

          <p><i>Introduced by Professor Ian Bryce Jones, Cinema and Media Studies.</i></p><p>A staple of South-East Asian Third Cinema, <i>Perfumed Nightmare</i> recounts the comic escapades of a jeepney driver intent on travelling to space. Quickly disillusioned by the toil of Western Europe, Kidlat (the main character and the director Kidlat Tahimik) transforms the film into a highly inventive satire of modern life and the supposed first world.</p>
