          <p><i>Preserved by the Library of Congress.</i></p><p>In this protofeminist protonoir, Olga (Aline MacMahon) and her sister (Ann Dvorak) run a gas station in the middle of the Mojave desert. When a shady character from Olga’s past shows up, the sisters’ hard-won independence is threatened. Packed with drama, lust, and sweaty longing, and featuring arresting cinematography, a powerful performance by Method pioneer MacMahon, and a shocking ending, this is a pre-code gem you won’t want to miss.</p>

          <p>“BUCK AND THE PREACHER is now a DCP screening, due to print availability. We apologize for the inconvenience.”</p>
          <p>Sidney Poitier stars in <i>Buck and the Preacher</i>, his directorial debut. Poitier’s protagonist strikes a fragile balance in the Reconstruction-era Southwest, seeking settlement for Black Americans by negotiating with indigenous tribes, all while avoiding white bounty hunters. The sudden entrance of a grifting man of the cloth (Harry Belafonte) threatens to throw Buck’s entire operation into chaos.</p>

          <h3>William Friedkin &middot; 122m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Based on a true story, <i>The Exorcist</i> ventures "somewhere between science and superstition" in the tale of an innocent young girl possessed by a foul-mouthed demon. Her mother desperately seeks help for her levitating, babbling daughter, but finds no answers in medicine--leaving Regan's salvation in the hands of two Catholic priests who must embark on an exorcism. Come for the thrilling religious horror, stay for the iconic torrents of green slime.</p>

          <h3>Jamal Sims &middot; 85m &middot; Digital</h3>
          <p>We all need an emotional boost after last week's pick. The one documentary to make it into this series, <i>When the Beat Drops</i> highlights the work of the Black and queer artists at the forefront of Atlanta’s bucking scene. Directed by choreographer Jamal Sims in a film only a dancer could make, <i>When the Beat Drops</i> is a propulsive showcase of contemporary underground dance and a powerful examination of the profound sacrifices artists make for their craft.</p>

          <h3>Roberta Findlay &middot; 84m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Originally a porno, we offer director Roberta Findlay’s preferred R-rated cut. Don and Frances are having marriage problems, in part due to Frances’ deeply traumatized sister Karen who overhears them discussing sending her to an asylum. Karen runs away to an empty beach house and starts killing people as her mental state deteriorates. This horror sexploitation film’s clever editing and distinct approach to horror make for a compelling experience.</p>

          <p><i>There will be an intermission.</i></p><p>Described by Pauline Kael as a testament to what Marxism in film could produce, this epic documentary spans the years leading up to and following the 1973 coup in Chile led by Augusto Pinochet and backed by the CIA (and distinguished alumni of UChicago). A massive undertaking for the filmmakers, and to some degree the audience, <i>The Battle of Chile</i> reveals the open wound created by right-wing authoritarianism and the dashed hopes of a nation’s social democracy.</p>
