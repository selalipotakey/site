These were 'the Janes,' and this is their story.

          <p>In perhaps her finest pre-Code turn, Barbara Stanwyck plays a daughter of a speakeasy owner who is inspired by Nietzsche to sleep her way to the top; and yes, the film is as eyebrow-raising as that logline sounds. Cited as one of the films whose edginess brought about the Hays Code, <i>Baby Face</i> is as delightful as it is important to Hollywood history. Keep your eye out too for John Wayne(!) in a pre-stardom role as one of Stanwyck's conquests.</p>

          <p>An ambitious deconstruction of language, translation, and concepts of national and personal identity, this documentary features a collage of Vietnamese women’s voices, challenging the form and politics of traditional filmed ethnography.
