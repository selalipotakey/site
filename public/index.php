          <p>After a string of unsuccessful films labeled her “box office poison,” Katherine Hepburn developed <i>The Philadelphia Story</i> as a comeback vehicle and was vindicated with a critical and commercial hit. Hepburn plays Tracy Lord, a Philadelphia socialite whose upcoming second marriage is drawing national attention. Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant co-star as a tabloid journalist and Tracy’s first husband, each of whose arrival complicates her wedding plans.</p>

          <h2>Bitter Money (2016)</h2>
          <h3>Wang Bing &middot; 163m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Pivoting from the legacy of forced labor in Maoist China, Wang Bing’s gaze now shifts toward present-day Huzhou, to the hundreds of thousands of migrants working 12 hours a day in its textile industry. Unflinching in its portrayal of poverty and the inescapable routines of industrialization, <i>Bitter Money</i> refuses to play into pornographic depictions of suffering. Instead, it is an emphathetic lens into the modern conditions of working-class China.</p>

Drenched in rich color and bursting with exquisitely choreographed action sequences, <i>Hero</i> may be the most beautiful piece of nationalist propaganda ever shot.</p>

          <h2>Strange Illusion (1945)</h2>
          <h3>Edgar G. Ulmer &middot; 87m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>A noir retelling of "Hamlet" in Southern California, <i>Strange Illusion</i> is assuredly odd -- even for the seasoned cinephile. Expert cinematography brings the extended dream sequences to life, blanketing audiences in the eerie confusion of a black-and-white fever dream. Starring Jimmy Lydon, Sally Eilers, and Warren William (the so-called "King of Pre-Code"), <i>Strange Illusion</i> is yet another distinct classic in auteur director Edgar G. Ulmer's world. <u>Preserved by the Library of Congress</u>.</p>

          <h3>Masaaki Yuasa &middot; 93m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>With an utterly surrealist style of Japanese animation painting an unforgettable drunken night, <i>The Night is Short, Walk on Girl</i> follows two unnamed students at Kyoto University. While the girl is enjoying a night full of parties, drinking contests, and supernatural beings, the guy is determined to find a successful way to ask her out.

          <h2>Enter the Void (2009)</h2>
          <h3>Gaspar Noé &middot; 143m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p><i>Enter the Void</i> is Gaspar Noé's psychedelic afterlife movie from hell—a movie you should keep away from the children, the parents, and the dog. Shot entirely from the point of view of Oscar (Nathaniel Brown), an American drug dealer killed by Tokyo police in a drug bust, the film follows Oscar's soul as it journeys through past, present, and future seeking resurrection. An extreme, exhilarating movie, it's guaranteed to leave beads of sweat on your brow.</p>

          <h3>S. S. Rajamouli &middot; 181m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p><i>RRR</i> is an exhilarating, action-packed spectacular mythologizing two real-life freedom fighters who helped lead India’s fight for independence from the British Raj: village guardian Komaram Bheem and Alluri Sitarama Raju, an ambitious Imperial officer. Set in the 1920s before their fight for India’s independence began, <i>RRR</i> imagines a fictional meeting between them, set into motion when a young Gond girl is stolen from her village by British soldiers. </p>

          <h2>Joan the Maid: The Battles (1994)</h2>
          <h3>Jacques Rivette &middot; 160m &middot; DCP</h3>
          <p>Countless films have been about Joan of Arc, but as critic Jonathan Rosenbaum noted, Rivette’s rigorously materialist version is “perhaps the only movie that offers a plausible portrait of what the 15th-century teenager who led the French into battle was actually like." In part one of this epic, young Joan (an extraordinary Sandrine Bonnaire) leaves her childhood home and persuades Charles VII to allow her to lead his troops in the war against the English.</p>
