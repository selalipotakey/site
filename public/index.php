                  </a>
                  <p class="capsule fittext"><i>The Long Goodbye</i> starts not with a bang, but with a vibe. Elliott Gould’s Philip Marlowe wanders through a 1973 L.A. laden with denizens who have little between their ears. In typical Robert Altman style, he sends Marlowe into a rabbit-hole of dead friends and strangers. Suspicion falls on Marlowe after an old friend’s wife is found dead, but this quickly becomes the least of his worries. Gangsters, alcoholic writers, and detox clinics all join Altman’s cavalcade symphony of Malibu vapidity.</p>

                  <p class="capsule fittext">This post-colonial fever dream of French Polynesia was voted best film of 2022 by Cahiers du Cinéma and "suggests John le Carré by way of David Lynch," per A.O. Scott. It's a slow-burning character study of High Commissioner De Roller (Benoît Magimel, The Piano Teacher), who floats through all walks of island life with an easy charisma. But the lush Tahitian setting pulses with a sense of dread that only grows as political alliances shift and unravel.</p>

                  </a>
                  <p class="capsule fittext">The beloved middle-child western sandwiched between the old-school and revisionists, The Searchers takes a decidedly complex look at one man’s delirious search for his abducted niece. Closer in spirit to Heart of Darkness than Gunsmoke, John Ford subtly questions the ideologies of the American west and its isolated inhabitants driven to humanity’s edge. With the mesmerizing imagery of Monument Valley as a backdrop for the likes of John Wayne and Natalie Wood, The Searchers serves as a touchstone for one of American cinema’s earliest reckonings with the racism of the American west(ern).</p>

                  <p class="capsule fittext">Taking place on a single day of a happening Los Angeles car wash, Michael Schultz’s film is the perfect summer comedy encapsulating the zeitgeist of a rapidly changing American landscape. With an all-star lineup that includes Richard Pryor, Bill Duke, George Carlin, the Pointer Sisters, and Franklyn Ajaye, <i>Car Wash</i> is a hilariously biting flick with an ineffable joie de vivre, and also a major milestone in ‘70s Black studio filmmaking.</p>

                  <p class="capsule fittext"><i>The Maltese Falcon</i> follows private detective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) as his search for the Maltese Falcon statuette entangles him in a web of deceit and murder. With a stellar cast including Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet, the film is filled to the brim with twists, double-crosses, and moral ambiguity. Written and directed by John Huston, this film noir classic will provide the perfect escape from the summer heat with its chilling atmospheric cinematography and sharp dialogue. </p>

          <p>Directed by one of the founding members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, WITHIN THE LAW centers Mary Turner, a courageous woman who vows to take vengeance on those who had her wrongfully imprisoned for a crime she did not commit. Norma Talmadge, one of the most popular idols of the silent era and a box-office powerhouse of the early 1920s, leads this silent era melodrama.</p>

          <h3>Quentin Tarantino &middot; 160m &middot; 35mm</h3>
          <p>Okay, but seriously, let’s just have some fun with this last one. Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) navigate the rapidly declining studio film industry as foreign and indie films seem more promising than ever before. Cliff and Rick rub elbows with all the So-Cal bigwigs and freaks: Sharon Tate, Polanski, Bruce Lee, Mama Cass, and a guy named Charlie Manson who seems to be planning something big. Tarantino’s chillest film to date, <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> feels like a perfect summer day ... but remember, something creepy is always lurking in the night.</p>
