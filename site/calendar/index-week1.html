							<h3>Salt of the Earth</h3>
							<p>Herbert Biberman | 16mm | 94m</p>
							<p>Made at the height of the red scare by a crew of blacklisted filmmakers, this film is one of the most audacious projects of political cinema in film history as a dramatization of a strike of Mexican-American zinc miners seeking a living wage and safe working conditions. Narrated from the perspective of a miners wife, the film sounds a powerful call for labour rights and racial equality and raises questions of gender and womens liberation.  </p>

							<h3>Battleship Potemkin</h3>
							<p>Sergei Eisenstein | Digital | 66m</p>
							<p>This double feature brings together two films that depict the coming together of a collective to confront exploitation. A monument of early Soviet cinema, Sergei Eisensteins  Battleship Potemkin  presents a dramatization of the naval mutiny that sparked the First Russian Revolution in 1905. Characterized by striking graphic compositions and inventive montage, the film would inspire leftist filmmakers across the globe, including the American photographer Paul Strand, who acted as the cinematographer for Fred Zinnemann and Emilio Gmez Muriels  Redes , which explores the political awakening of a group of fishermen. Filled with stunning images of waves, clouds, and laboring bodies, this recently restored film offers a lyrical but hard-hitting portrayal of work and resistance on the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

							<p>Agnès Varda | DCP | 82m</p>
							<p>In this documentary, Agns Varda takes the practice of gleaningthe act of gathering leftover food and discarded objectsas the occasion for a playful and self-reflexive inquiry into practices of scavenging, reuse, and art-making at the margins of modern-day consumerism. The film presents a fascinating portrayal of labor and collectivity outside the market while at the same time offering a vision of abundance and beauty in the least expected places.</p>

							<p>The problem is not to make political films, but to make films politically.  Jean-Luc Godard. Marin Karmitzs forceful depiction of a wildcat strike carried out by textile factory workers in Rouen was also an experiment in collective filmmaking, with all members of the cast and crew receiving an equal salary. The cast, consisting largely of unemployed factory workers, helped shape the script by sharing their own experiences of labor struggle.</p>

							<p>Barbara Kopple&#39;s Academy Award winning documentary of the Brookside Strike depicts mineworkers struggling for solidarity amongst injunctions, scabs, and armed thugs perpetrated by the Duke Power Company.

							<h3>Finally Got the News</h3>
							<p>Rene Lichtman, Peter Gessner, Stewart BirdG | Digital | 55m</p>
							<p>Filmed from 1969-70, this documentary offers a look at the League of Revolutionary Black Workers as they organized in Detroit against both the big car companies and their racist and anti-democratic union leadership. The League and their view that both the oppression and the potential power of Black Americans is located in the workplace stands in contrast with many New Left groups of their era, including the white activist documentarians. </p>

							<h3>Archangel</h3>
							<p>Guy Maddin | 35mm | 90m</p>
							<p>In the Arkhangelsk region of Russia in 1919, a one-legged Canadian solider and victim of amnesia (by way of mustard gas) mistakes a nurse for his dead wife. Meanwhile, her own husband, suffering the same affliction, forgets that he is married. Filmed in a style reminiscent of the late silent to early talkie era of cinema,  Archangel  is perhaps the only film fictionalizing the Bolshevik Revolution that features an invasion of bunny rabbits. </p>

							<h3>Careful</h3>
							<p>Guy Maddin | 35mm | 100m</p>
							<p>Guy Maddin&#39;s third film is set in Tolzbad, a fictional 19th century Alpine village where citizens must whisper for fear of their voices setting off an avalanche. A parable about sexual repression that eventually twists itself into incestuous love triangles and familial intrigue, Maddin&#39;s first color film mixes German expressionism and the color tinting of old silent films with a vivid surrealness that is reminiscent of  The Wizard of Oz . </p>

							<p>Guy Maddin | 35mm | 75m</p>
							<p>Maddin underlines the erotic horror lurking in Bram Stoker&#39;s story as well as infusing it with his signature humor with title cards like, She&#39;s filled with polluted blood! Dracula is interpreted by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, set to Mahler and shot like a silent film on low-res formats including 16mm and Super 8. Admittedly not a fan of ballet or Dracula when first commissioned, Maddin transcends preconceptions about either into a work all his own.</p>

This manga adaptation tells of a sadomasochistic gangster who seeks to battle an infamous assassin known for his gruesomeness. Little does he know that the assassin, the titular Ichi, is actually a brainwashed crybaby who can only kill when forced into a panic attack.

Ostensibly a family drama, _The Daughters of Kim’s Pharmacy_ (dir.
